         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>How not only eaÅ¿y and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but profitable the Planting of Fruit-trees is, will be needleÅ¿s to make a diÅ¿courÅ¿e on, Å¿ince not only ThouÅ¿ands of People, but whole Counties can infallibly evidence by their daily experience the many and vaÅ¿t advantages thereof. Only our Saturnine Northern People are not very inclinable thereunto, out of a certain conceited and inbred hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, of not doing any thing their AnceÅ¿tours have not cared for, which makes them tenaciouÅ¿ly adhere to

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:154132:10"/>keep in Sand till <hi>October</hi>) do it by a Line, pricking holes about Å¿ix Inches diÅ¿tance one from another, and then put in the Stones about two Inches deep, with the Å¿harp end uppermoÅ¿t: When one Row is finiÅ¿hed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move your Line a Foot farther, and Å¿et an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Row in the Å¿ame manner; but let your third Row be about a Yard diÅ¿tant from the Å¿econd, that you may have liberty to go between every two Rows to Weed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And Å¿et your Plum-Å¿tones and Cherry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tones each apart by themÅ¿elves, and Å¿o pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to Å¿et as many as you have a mind.

Some keep their Stones in Sand or Earth, in Tubs (well cover'd for fear of Mice) placed in a dry Cellar, in a HouÅ¿e, and then in <hi>February</hi> they Sow them (having prepared their ground) in Trench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, as PeaÅ¿e are Sown. The Stones of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricocks and Peaches are apt to Å¿pring too forward, if Å¿et too Å¿oon, and be nipt by FroÅ¿ts.

                     <p>When either you or any Neighbour hath made Cyder, Verjuice or Perry, take the MuÅ¿t, Murc, (or as Å¿ome call it the Pouz) which is the Å¿ubÅ¿tance of the fruit after the Juice is preÅ¿Å¿ed out, the Å¿ame day or the next day after, before it heats, and with a Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Å¿ift out the Seeds on a clean Floor, or Cloth, and theÅ¿e you muÅ¿t Å¿ow (as Å¿oon as you can conveniently) upon Beds of very fine Earth, very thick; for Å¿ome being brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed in the grinding or pounding the fruit, and others not being ripe, may never come up; then Å¿ift Mold upon them, about two Fingers breadth in thickneÅ¿s. This way is much better than to Sow the Seeds with the MuÅ¿t, Murc, or Pouz together, (as Å¿ome do) becauÅ¿e the MuÅ¿t will heat them, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Seeds will putrifie, and others will not be able to root or Å¿hoot up, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e they are Å¿o impriÅ¿on'd in that dry and tough Å¿tuff, clinging about them.</p>

                     <p>Some cover the Beds with Fern or Straw, to keep them warm in the <hi>Winter,</hi> which may not do amiÅ¿s, but then it muÅ¿t be taken off at the Springs approach.</p>
                     <p>If Moles or Mice get in (which you may eaÅ¿ily diÅ¿cover, becauÅ¿e the Mice leave Å¿hells of the Seeds on the top of the Beds) they muÅ¿t be deÅ¿troyed.</p>
                     <p>For Mice, lay PoiÅ¿on, or Oatmeal mixt with GlaÅ¿s pounded Å¿mall, and Butter, and caÅ¿t bits of it upon the Beds, or Å¿et Traps for Moles or Mice, better known than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cribed.</p>
                     <p>The next Spring you will Å¿ee theÅ¿e Stones and Seeds come up plentifully; firÅ¿t the Leaves, almoÅ¿t of the Å¿hape of the Kernel Å¿plit in two, and from betwixt them will the Stem Put forth. Keep them clean from the Weeds all the year, which muÅ¿t be plucked up while they are young, leÅ¿t if they get Root, in drawing them up, you root up the Seedlings with them; but if in the Weeding any Seedlings come up, Å¿et them again almoÅ¿t to the top; then water them.</p>

                     <p>The Seeds of Pears yield the beÅ¿t Å¿tocks for Pear-trees.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="6" facs="tcp:154132:12"/>Grafting Pear-Grafts or Cyens on a white Thorn or Quince Å¿tock, will make the Tree to be of Å¿mall growth, and the Fruit bad, having hard and Å¿tony Cores, if grafted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Thorn Tree.</p>
                     <p>Black Cherry Å¿tones and Red Cherry Å¿tones yield Å¿tocks to Graft or Inoculate Cherries on; but the Black Cherry Å¿tocks are beÅ¿t; for they yield goodly Å¿traight large Plants, and full of Sap, and become greater Trees than thoÅ¿e produced of Red Cherry Å¿tones, and conÅ¿equently more proper for Orchards and Fields.</p>
                     <p>To Inoculate an Apricock very low on a white Pear-Plum Å¿tock, or on a Wheat-Plum-Å¿tock, and then after a Years growth Inoculate a Peach or a Nectarine on it, is highly approved; only this way there will be two Years loÅ¿s of time: And note that the red Roman Nectarine will Å¿carce take on a Plum-Å¿tock any other way.</p>

                     <p>But if you intend to propagate any deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Apple which is over tart in taÅ¿te, Graft it on Å¿ome Å¿tock raiÅ¿ed of the Gennet Moyl, or Å¿ome Å¿weet Apple Tree, which will Å¿weeten its juice Å¿omething.

                     <p>However where you cannot conveniently be Å¿tored with Crab-kernels, Apple-ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels are not Å¿o much inferiour to them, but they may well enough be made uÅ¿e of (as they commonly are) for raiÅ¿ing Å¿tocks to Graft Apples upon.</p>

TheÅ¿e Cyens or Grafts you get ought to be the laÅ¿t years Shoots, Å¿trong and very well grown, that grow on the top or out-Å¿ide of a Tree, that Å¿everal years expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of thoÅ¿e that know it, can faithfully aÅ¿Å¿ure you bears very well, and good fruit of its kind; and cut not off the tops of the Cyens until that you graft them, for Å¿o they will keep better; but immediately after grafting, the tops of Grafts are to be cut at a Bud, that they may Å¿pread the better, and of Å¿uch as are but Å¿hort, if there be BloÅ¿Å¿om-buds on the top, as it's commonly Å¿een in Pearmain-Cyens, and many other good bearing kinds. Grafts that are very Å¿mall and Å¿lender commonly fail, therefore chooÅ¿e the faireÅ¿t, fulleÅ¿t, and Å¿trongeÅ¿t Å¿hoot of the laÅ¿t years growth, and fulleÅ¿t of Buds, and of good bearing kinds, elÅ¿e you may have fair Trees, and little or no Fruit on them, and Å¿o fancy you have an Orchard, though Å¿eldom Fruit; for Å¿ome Trees will
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:154132:23"/>grow and bloÅ¿Å¿om very well, yet rarely bear Fruits; the reaÅ¿on is, for that they were grafted from bad bearing Trees, and are of bad bearing kinds.</p>
                     <p>A Å¿hoot or Branch of the year next fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going makes the beÅ¿t Cyens or Graft, and thrives beÅ¿t, though in <hi>HerefordÅ¿hire,</hi> when they graft old Trees, they commend and uÅ¿e Cyens of two or three years growth, yet thoÅ¿e are Å¿eldom found to have convenient Buds to put forth at, and often times have bloÅ¿Å¿oming Buds on them, and make not Å¿o good a growth, neither have they Å¿o good a joint to graft at as thoÅ¿e of the laÅ¿t year.</p>
                     <p>When you get Grafts, you had beÅ¿t cut off at leaÅ¿t three Inches of that which grew the year before with them, beÅ¿ides the laÅ¿t years Shoot, for Å¿o they will keep the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and you may uÅ¿e about an Inch and an half of that old Wood in every Cyens when you Graft it.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps you may not have Å¿everal Å¿orts of Plums, Cherries, or Pears Å¿o near you, as that you may get Buds freÅ¿h enough for Inoculation: In this caÅ¿e you may procure Cyens, and graft them, and they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue freÅ¿h, though you Å¿hould Å¿end for them from beyond Sea.</p>
                     <p>TheÅ¿e Cyens or Grafts of any kind may be grafted immediately after they are got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and that Å¿ucceÅ¿sfully; or they may be kept three Weeks or a Month before they are uÅ¿ed, and there ought to be a Fortnight
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:154132:24"/>or three Weeks betwixt the time of their being cut, and their being grafted, that the Stocks in that time may be repleniÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Sap, and the Cyens more empty of it; and then they will quicker incorporate by more greedily attracting the Sap out of the Stock.</p>
                     <p>To keep your Cyens or Grafts after they are cut, you need not, as Å¿ome direct, bury them in moiÅ¿t Mold; for this may be a means to make them Å¿well and bud forth by receiving moiÅ¿ture from the Earth; and then when by grafting they are expoÅ¿ed to the cold open Air, they will be in danger to wither and die before they have nouriÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Stock. You may lay them in a dry houÅ¿e, Å¿o it be near no heat, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Å¿hade of an old Tree or Hedge, and cover them all over with dry Mold, that the Air may not have too much Influence upon them: though they Å¿eem Å¿omewhat dry, yet if they cut with a freÅ¿h colour, and be not much withered, they will not grow the worÅ¿e, but rather the better; yea Å¿ome that have Å¿eemed withered, being carried 70 or 80 Miles, have grown well. And they may be carried hundreds of Miles in a Box of Mold, or their ends Å¿tuck in Clay, or a Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nip, and wrapped about with green freÅ¿h MoÅ¿s, that they bruiÅ¿e not; bind not many together; for if Å¿o, thoÅ¿e in the middle will dry, and be Å¿poiled in certain days, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lay them thin in the Mold.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="31" facs="tcp:154132:24"/>Be very careful that the Buds be neither hurt or rub'd in the binding or carriage of the Å¿aid Grafts.</p>
                     <p>In providing Cyens or Grafts of Pears, Plums, and Cherries, you muÅ¿t cut them in the beginning of <hi>February,</hi> having reÅ¿pect to the forwardneÅ¿s or backwardneÅ¿s of the Spring, and the warmth or coldneÅ¿s of the Country you live in; but you muÅ¿t be Å¿ure to cut them before the Buds have any Å¿peck of white appear on them.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Of joints and height of grafting</note>Â§. 4. There be Å¿ome indifferent whether they graft at a joint or no, but forecaÅ¿t to have a Bud directly behind the Å¿houlder of the Cyen; if Cyens with joints were Å¿carce, you might practice Å¿o on Å¿mall Stocks, that will Å¿peedily be cover'd, but if Cyens can be had with joints, never graft with others, for theÅ¿e will cover the Stocks Å¿ooner. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:154132:25"/>this is the opinion of many, yet I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways grafted at one of the loweÅ¿t Buds on the thicker end of the laÅ¿t years Shoot or Sprout, and valued not a joint of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer years growth, unleÅ¿s the Graft were too Å¿hort; for the Å¿traiter and Å¿moother your Graft is, the more exactly you may fit it to your Stock, eÅ¿pecially if your Stock be young, and have but a thin Sap, and this was very Å¿ucceÅ¿sful; however grafting at a joint may do well if the Stock have a thick Sap or Bark, as commonly your Wood-Å¿tocks and all large Trees have. The wood below the knot or Å¿eam is commonly crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and not Å¿o Å¿mooth and Å¿traight as the wood below a Bud on the thicker end of the laÅ¿t years Shoot; therefore rather graft at a Bud, becauÅ¿e you may joyn the Graft and Stock the more exactly.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Height to graft at.</note>Â§. 5. If you Graft Apple or Pear-Cyens, graft a Foot or leÅ¿s from the ground; do the like for Wall-trees and Dwarf-trees, but if you graft Cherry or Plum-Cyens, for Å¿tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dards in Orchards or Fields, graft them Å¿ix or Å¿even Foot high, and at that height let them begin to Å¿pread; and when you graft, cut the top of the Cyen or Graft off cloÅ¿e above a Bud, about four or five Inches above the Shoulder, if it be for a Standard-tree, two Buds above the Clay being full enough; but for Dwarfs or Wall-trees, you may let the Cyens or Grafts be Å¿ix Inches or more
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:154132:25"/>long, with Å¿everal Buds, that they may Å¿hoot forth many Branches and Å¿pread from the very Stock. If you Graft old Apple, or Pear-trees, or their Branches, you muÅ¿t Graft according to the thickneÅ¿s of their Branches, which is uÅ¿ually Å¿even or eight Foot high or more. It will do well in Graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Stocks for large Å¿tandards, to put but one Cyens or Graft into a Stock (unleÅ¿s the Stock be very large, or an old Tree you Graft) and if it put forth Å¿everal Shoots, to cut off all but one, that is the Å¿traighteÅ¿t and Å¿trongeÅ¿t: But for Dwarffs and Wall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruit, put in two Cyens if the Stock be big enough; let the later be Grafted near the ground, the former at Å¿uch height you think fit, and the Stock will allow.</p>

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:154132:27"/>part below it be Å¿mooth and Å¿traight; (the Knot or Seam is a Circle round about the Graft, dividing and diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hing the laÅ¿t Summers growth from the former) or from Å¿ome one Bud on the lower part of the laÅ¿t years Shoot, or Sprout, down Å¿lopewiÅ¿e in the Wood till it be cut quite off, in that the Å¿lope may be about an Inch long or Å¿omthing more, obÅ¿erving it's bent, that when the Graft or Cyen is fixed to the Stock, it may Å¿tand almoÅ¿t upright; and cut the Graft or Cyen thin at the bottom of cut place, yet leave on all the Bark on the oppoÅ¿ite Å¿ide; then give a cut croÅ¿s through the Bark at the top of the Slope, and then cut a thin Chip of that Slope upward to the croÅ¿s cut, that there may be a Å¿houlder to reÅ¿t on the top of the Stock, but cut not this Å¿houlder too deep, little more than through the Bark will be enough, and this will cauÅ¿e a little riÅ¿ing in the Sloped part, which you muÅ¿t cut down, that the whole Slope may be plain and Å¿mooth, without dints or riÅ¿ings, and lie even and cloÅ¿e to the Å¿ide of the Stock. Cut then the top of the Cyen off, cloÅ¿e above a Bud, about four In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches above the Å¿houlder if it be for a Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard-tree, two Buds above the Clay being full enough; but for Dwarf, or Wall-trees, you may let the Cyen or Graft be Å¿ix Inches long with Å¿everal Buds, that they may Å¿hoot forth many Branches, and Å¿pread from the very Stock.</p>

                        <pb n="38" facs="tcp:154132:28"/>The Cyen or Graft thus prepared, lay the cut part of the Cyen or Graft upon the Å¿traight Å¿ide of the Stock, and if it may be, on the WeÅ¿t, or South-weÅ¿t Å¿ide of the Stock, and Å¿o meaÅ¿ure and mark the juÅ¿t length and breadth of; it then cut away Å¿o much of the Bark of the Stock, as the cut part of the Cyen or Graft may fit, drawing your Knife upwards; but as the Stock is bigger, and the Bark thicker than that on the Cyen, or Graft, Å¿o the Chip muÅ¿t be longer and broader, or els the paÅ¿Å¿age of the Sap in the Stock and Cyen or Graft (which is chieÅ¿ly betwixt the Bark and the wood) will not meet together, which Å¿hould and muÅ¿t be aimed at, as in the work you will eaÅ¿ily Å¿ee.</p>
                     <p>Then lay the cut part of the Cyen or Graft on the cut part of the Stock, and let the Å¿houlder of the Graft or Cyen reÅ¿t di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly upon the top of the Stock, Å¿o that the cut parts of both may joyn even and Å¿mooth all along, and Å¿o bind them together cloÅ¿e, with courÅ¿e woollen Yarn, BaÅ¿Å¿es, or the inward peeling of the Witch-tree, if you bind with Å¿uch materials as will not be looÅ¿e or rotten by MidÅ¿ummer; about that time give the binding a cut croÅ¿s-wiÅ¿e with a Knife to Å¿et the priÅ¿oners at liberty: Have in readineÅ¿s Å¿ome Clay free from Å¿tones, well mixt with HorÅ¿e-dung, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (<hi>Vide</hi> Chap. 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2.) and daub it about the Stock and Cyen, an Inch above the head of the Stock,

                     <p>This way of Grafting is commended by Å¿ome, as <hi>Mr. Langford,</hi> tho others diÅ¿ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove thereof; yet I have Grafted large Stocks often this way, and very Å¿ucceÅ¿sfully, but with Å¿mall Stocks I Å¿eldom had the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ired SucceÅ¿s, tho as careful in the operation as poÅ¿Å¿ible; but the firÅ¿t way I take to be the beÅ¿t for them, for theÅ¿e reaÅ¿ons.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. BecauÅ¿e Stocks may be Grafted Å¿o, Å¿ome years before they can be ready to Graft in the Cleft, and though Whip-grafting may be uÅ¿ed Å¿ooner than that way, yet there are other great inconveniences attending it.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="41" facs="tcp:154132:29"/>II. The Stocks this way are leÅ¿s harmed than where a Cleft is uÅ¿ed, becauÅ¿e the Cleft lets wet into them, and rots and makes them not Å¿o fit for Grafting again, (if any fail to grow the firÅ¿t time) as theÅ¿e continue to be, though they Å¿hould once miÅ¿carry.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. The Cyen will much Å¿ooner cover the Stock and make a more Å¿ound, health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Å¿wifter growing Tree.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. This is more Å¿peedy, eaÅ¿y, and Å¿ure to Å¿ucceed. Therefore if the Stock exceed three Inches Diameter at the place it's cut off, the beÅ¿t way is to Graft in the Rind or Bark, and you may Å¿et many Grafts round the Stock, and they will Å¿ooner cover the Stock; but if the Stock be from one Inch to three Inches Diameter, then Graft in the Cleft; if under one Inch Diameter, then by Å¿licing, Packing on, or Whip-graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>Grafting in the Rind is attended with Å¿ome inconvenience; for the Grafts uÅ¿ually make large Shoots the firÅ¿t Year, which in caÅ¿e the Wind happen to blow Å¿trongly on the oppoÅ¿ite Å¿ide of the Stock where the Graft is, commonly it is broken off, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as yet no other hold than in the Bark or Rind, and being top heavy with all, is eaÅ¿ily broken: but after one Year the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is paÅ¿t, becauÅ¿e that which grows Å¿o plentifully at the joyning of the Graft and Stock the firÅ¿t Year being but Å¿appy Rind, the next Year is converted into Å¿olid Wood.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:154132:30"/>Some well approve by their experience the Grafting Stocks above three Inches Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by placing two Grafts oppoÅ¿ite to each other in the Cleft, and other two oppoÅ¿ite to each other in the Bark, Å¿o that you may place four Grafts in Å¿uch a large Stock, and they will Å¿oon cover the Stocks head.</p>
                     <p>Â§. 3. There is another way of Grafting Å¿mall Stocks call'd Whip-grafting;<note place="margin">Whip-grafting.</note> and here your Graft or Cyen, and Stock ought to be exactly of the Å¿ame bigneÅ¿s as the manner of performing it plainly Å¿hews, <hi>viz.</hi> Slope off the Cyen or Graft a full Inch or longer, and do the like to the Stock, and tye the one upon the other; both the Stock and Cyen ought to be cut at the Å¿mootheÅ¿t and Å¿traighteÅ¿t place. You may if you will make a Shoulder on the Cyen, and cut the top of the Stock to Å¿uit with it, and then bind them together, and Clay them about the place. If you joyn the Inner Bark of the Cyen and Stock exactly together at either Å¿ide, it will grow, tho not Å¿o well as where the Cyen and Stock are of an equal proportion.</p>
                     <p>This way call'd Whip-grafting, is Å¿ucceÅ¿s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful enough, Å¿o that Å¿pecial care be taken that both Stock and Cyen Å¿uit exactly where they are joyned together, which is Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what troubleÅ¿ome to do; and Å¿o is it to find Cyens and Stocks of an equal bigneÅ¿s; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ides the head will be apt to overgrow the Stocks; all that can be done to prevent it,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:154132:30"/>is to Graft theÅ¿e very low; or if high to give the Stock more liberty to thicken by Å¿litting the Bark of it with a Knife almoÅ¿t to the wood.</p>
                     <p>In this way of Grafting there is another little Knack may be added to very good purpoÅ¿e, and that is, when the Stock and Cyen are prepared (as you heard before) to be joined together, to make a Å¿lit, or Notch with a Knife in the bare place of the Stock downward, beginning towards the top of the Å¿lope, and Å¿o Å¿litting or Notching it a little way, and doing the like in the Å¿lop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed face of the Cyen, but beginning at the Å¿ame diÅ¿tance from the lower end of it, as you did before from the top of the Stock, and Å¿o carrying it upwards, and then joyn them by thruÅ¿ting the one Å¿lice into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till the bare place of the Cyen cover the bare place of the Stock.</p>
                     <p>This may be done likwiÅ¿e in Grafting by Packing, and in both conduceth much to Å¿trengthen the work, and is called by Å¿ome Lipping, or Tounging.</p>
                     <p>In Whip-grafting the cut parts both of the Graft and Stock, muÅ¿t joyn and anÅ¿wer one another from the top to the bottom.</p>
                     <p>This way of Whip-grafting is commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Å¿ome, not only for the Å¿ame reaÅ¿on as Å¿litting or Packing on is, but alÅ¿o becauÅ¿e the Graft Å¿oon covers the Stock, which is not impaired by Å¿litting or cleaving, and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:154132:31"/>the Graft having it's Wood, as well as it's Rind bound to the Stock, is not Å¿o apt to break off, as that which is Grafted only in the Rind, nor is the Graft apt to be top heavy, the Stocks being Å¿maller af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford not Å¿o plentiful NouriÅ¿hment.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Grafting in the Cleft or Å¿lit.</note>Â§. 4. The next way of Grafting is call'd Grafting in the Cleft, which is the moÅ¿t Antient and common way of Grafting, and if carefully managed, not inferior to any other way of Grafting, tho the modern Planters do Å¿omthing Å¿light it: You may Graft any Stock this way, from half an Inch to three Inches Diameter, and that if the Stock be no bigger than the Graft too, if you have neat Tools, and be ready in the managery thereof, and with good Å¿ucceÅ¿s, as I have frequently experienced. The manner is thus, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Cut off the top of the Stock in Å¿ome Å¿mooth and Å¿triaght place, that may be anÅ¿waerble to the Å¿traightneÅ¿s of the Graft that is put into the Cleft; if you do it with a Hand-Å¿aw, cut it Å¿mooth afterwards with a Knife, leaving the top flat and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                     <p>Then cleave the Stock with a Å¿trong Knife, (or the ChiÅ¿el before deÅ¿cribed at <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. in <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.) Let the Å¿lit run about two Inches deep, and let it be as near the middle of the Stock as you can, but not in the Pith or heart, and let the Å¿lit be on the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:154132:31"/>Å¿omotheÅ¿t Å¿ides of the Stock. Have in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineÅ¿s the Steel IinÅ¿trument before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2, or els a Stick of hard Wood near a foot long, at one end made like a Wedge; when you have taken out the Cleaver, put one end of the InÅ¿trument, or els the Wedge into the Å¿lit or cleft of the Stock, and open it Å¿o wide as to put in the Cyen, when it is prepared, and made ready for that purpoÅ¿e.</p>
                     <p>Which is by cutting the Graft or Cyen from the joynt, knot, or Å¿eam, if it be Å¿traight, or els from Å¿ome Bad on the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er end of the laÅ¿t years Shoot or Sprout down aÅ¿lope on both Sides,<note place="margin">The Å¿lope cut off the Graft Å¿hould be an Inch and half long at leaÅ¿t, if the Stock be big enough to allow it.</note> Å¿omthing more than an Inch long, making it thin at the bottom, and in Å¿hape like a Wedge, very Å¿mooth and even without dints or riÅ¿ings, that it may joyn cloÅ¿e all along; Å¿o far as it goes into the Cleft of the Stock, let the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ide of the Graft or Cyen be Å¿omewhat thicker than the inner Å¿ide, unleÅ¿s the Stock be Å¿o big as to pinch the Cyen or Graft much, then make the Cyen or Graft as thick on that Å¿ide that goes into the Stock as on the outÅ¿ide, which will prevent the Stocks hurting the Sappy part, and Bark of the Cyen or Graft, by preÅ¿erving the outÅ¿ide from being pinched too much.</p>
                     <p>You may let the Graft or Cyen have on the uppermoÅ¿t part of the Å¿lope, a Å¿houlder on one Å¿ide, or both, or neither; all theÅ¿e ways are uÅ¿ed, but Å¿houldering takes up more
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:154132:32"/>time, and makes the Cyen or Graft weaker, and Å¿o apter by chance to be broke off; then with your Å¿harp Pen-knife cut away any Jags, or roughneÅ¿s, or blackneÅ¿s that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains after cleaving, on each Å¿ide of the Cleft of the Stock within, and Å¿o put in either one, or two Cyens or Grafts; if the Stock be large, place them Å¿o as the paÅ¿Å¿age of the Sap betwixt the Bark and Wood both of the Stock, and Cyen or Graft may meet and joyn all along the Cleft as near as you can; for you muÅ¿t be Å¿ure always to joyn the inner Å¿ide of the Bark of the Cyen or Graft to the inner Å¿ide of the Bark of the Stock all along the Cleft, that the Sap may come out of the Stock to feed the Graft and make it grow.</p>
                     <p>The Graft being thus placed in the Stock draw forth the InÅ¿trument, or Wedge, and Clay them cloÅ¿e on every Å¿ide, and an Inch above the top of the Stock, and an Inch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the bottom of the Cleft, and keep Clay on about the Grafted part untill the Stock be covered with the Graft, and it will be the Å¿ounder Tree.</p>
                     <p>If you put but one Graft or Cyen in (which is beÅ¿t unleÅ¿s the Stock be large,) then cut off a piece with a Å¿lope cut from the top of the Stock about an Inch and half deep on the worÅ¿t Å¿ide of the Stock, the Graft being to be put on the Å¿traighteÅ¿t and Å¿mootheÅ¿t Å¿ide, in cutting the Stock thus, the Graft will cover over the Å¿ooner.</p>

                        <pb n="47" facs="tcp:154132:32"/>Many cleave big Stocks croÅ¿Å¿wiÅ¿e again, and put in two more Cyens; but cleaving hurts the Stocks Å¿o much that it's better (if you will have more than two Cyens in one Stock) Graft the other two in the Bark, according to the Å¿econd way of Graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but forecaÅ¿ting one of them to be on the WeÅ¿t Å¿ide of the Stock; But two Grafts are enough for any Stock.</p>
                     <p>It's an Erronious practiÅ¿e to Å¿et the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ide of the Stock and Graft even and Å¿mooth; becauÅ¿e the Bark of a big Stock is much thicker than the Bark of a Å¿lender Graft, and conÅ¿equently if the outÅ¿ide be Å¿mooth and even, the inÅ¿ide muÅ¿t needs be uneven, but where the Graft and Stock are almoÅ¿t of an equal proportion, there you may Å¿et them Å¿mooth on the outÅ¿ide, but where the Stock is large, Å¿et the cut part of the Graft more inward into the Cleft of the Stock.</p>
                     <p>When you cut Grafts it's very convenient to leave a Bud or two on the outÅ¿ide of the cut place, that in caÅ¿e any of the Grafts happen to be broken off, Å¿uch Bud or Buds on the outÅ¿ide, will Å¿pring out, and Å¿upply the defect, altho the Graft be broken off, even to the top of the Stock; or you may leave the Bud juÅ¿t at the Å¿houlder where the Graft joyns to the top of the Stock, and it will anÅ¿wer the Å¿aid intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>

                        <pb n="48" facs="tcp:154132:33"/>The only objection that is raiÅ¿ed againÅ¿t Grafting in the Cleft, is, that the Stock being Å¿lit or cloven, the Rain is apt to get in and decay the Stock, and Å¿ometimes the Graft too, therefore caution muÅ¿t be uÅ¿ed, not only the firÅ¿t year, but untill the head of the Stock be covered with the Graft, to keep well tempered Clay on the Graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed part both, of Cyen and Stock, and that as far as the Cleft extends it Å¿elf, to keep out both Wet and Air.</p>

I once Å¿aw a man Graft half a dozen Å¿mall Stocks thus; After he had cut off the top of the Stock, he cut it on each Å¿ide from the top a Å¿lope about an Inch and half, directly like a Wedg reverÅ¿t, then he clove with his Pen-knife the Graft from the bottom in the middle of the Graft an Inch and half, then he plac'd this Graft on the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ock, one Å¿ide of the Graft on one Å¿ide of the Stock, and the other on the other, but joyn'd Sap to Sap, and then bound and Clayd it; theÅ¿e Grafts took well, and it's an eaÅ¿y way of Grafting.</p>
                     <p>Â§. 8. Some have an Iron InÅ¿trument made for the purpoÅ¿e, which will make a Nick or Notch in the Stock up to it's head, an Inch and half long through the Bark, and Å¿ome depth into the Wood, in form of an v, or rather after this form, V, then fit the Graft, and put it into the Noch, joying Sap to Sap, and bind them together with BaÅ¿s, and Clay them. This way is much commended.</p>

                     <p>Â§. 1. INoculating is the taking off a Bud from one Tree, and putting it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Bark and the Wood of another Tree or Stock; the end and intention is the Å¿ame with other ways of Grafting; and moreover by this way, divers Å¿orts of Fruits, which are not apt to take or grow by ordinary ways of Grafting, are by this eaÅ¿ily encreaÅ¿ed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculating.</note>Â§. 2. About a fortnight before or after MidÅ¿ummer (which is the beÅ¿t time, though it may be done from the beginning of <hi>May</hi> untill <hi>AuguÅ¿t</hi>) when you have pitcht upon Å¿uch Stocks as are fit to be Inoculated, to get the Bud from, chooÅ¿e out a Å¿trong and well liking Branch, or Shoot of that years growth, upon a Tree that bears exceeding well, and Å¿uch kind of Fruits as you would by this operation produce, and about the mid le, or lower end of it, (for the top will be too tender) fix upon a leaf that hath a freÅ¿h and fair Bud growing out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:154132:35"/>it and the Bark, and about half an Inch below and above the Bud, cut off the Branch, and Å¿o you will have a piece of it about an Inch long remaining, with a Bud and Leaf on, this you muÅ¿t cleave juÅ¿t through the midÅ¿t, Å¿o as the Bud may be directly in the middle of the one half; and then Å¿nip off a part of the Leaf; and holding it by the remainder, clap it to a Å¿mooth Straight place on the Stock, and with a Pen-knife Å¿core out, on each Å¿ide of it, Å¿o much of the Stock as it covers, or rather a little broader, (becauÅ¿e when the Bark on which the Bud is, is taken off from it's own Wood, and applyed to the Stock, it will cover a wider Å¿pace of the Stock than it did before) After you have thus marked your Stock, with-draw the Cyen again, and cut the Bark through where you had marked it; then cut the Bark croÅ¿s and Å¿traight from the uppermoÅ¿t end of one Å¿core to the upper end of the other, and cut the Bark again croÅ¿s and Å¿traight from one Å¿core to the other, but not Å¿o low as the Lower ends of the Å¿cores, by a quarter of an Inch; then take the oblong Å¿quare piece of Bark, that is cut on every Å¿ide, quite off the Stock, and raiÅ¿e up that part of the Bark that remains betwixt the Å¿ide-Å¿cores at the bottom of the work, from the Wood, till you come to the lower end of the Å¿ide-Å¿cores.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="54" facs="tcp:154132:36"/>Take then a GooÅ¿e-quill, cut in the faÅ¿hion of an Apple-Å¿coop, or Å¿craper, and having with your Nail a little looÅ¿ned the upper part of that Bark that is on the Cyen, thruÅ¿t the Quill betwixt the Bark and the Wood, that it may Å¿eparate them, and take off with the Bark a little Wood or Root of the Bud over againÅ¿t it: If you Å¿ee a hole on the inÅ¿ide over againÅ¿t the Bud, when you have taken the Bark off, caÅ¿t it away, that little labour is loÅ¿t, and try another till you find it otherwiÅ¿e.</p>
                     <p>Then put in the lower end of that Bark or Cyen betwixt the Bark that was raiÅ¿ed on the Stock and the Wood, and Å¿o bind it on the Stock gently with Woollen-yarn, or narrow Shreds of Linnen Cloth, or gentle Stuff, or with BaÅ¿Å¿es, or BaÅ¿t, of which the RuÅ¿Å¿ia Matts are made, but Å¿o that the Cyen may Lye cloÅ¿e to the Wood of the Stock that was made bare, and have an eÅ¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial care that you hurt not the Bud.</p>
                     <p>Â§. 3. There are Å¿ome other ways of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculating uÅ¿ed, differing only in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the cut, both in the Bark of the Stock, and of the Cyen.</p>
                     <p>And firÅ¿t, Å¿ome proceeding in all other things, as is before directed, cut the Bark out of the whole length of the Å¿ide-Å¿cores, and apply the Cyen to the disbarked place.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="55" facs="tcp:154132:36"/>Â§. 4. Others cut one Å¿lit only down the Bark of the Stock, and another croÅ¿s the the top of it, like a great T, when this is done, they prepare the Cyen or Bark as before directed (only cutting it Å¿harp point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the lower end before they take the Bud off it's Wood) Then raiÅ¿e the Bark of the Stock up on each Å¿ide the Å¿lit, and put in the Cyen, beginning at the top and Å¿lid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it downward gently, and let the top of the Bud joyn cloÅ¿e to the croÅ¿s-cut in the upper end, and Å¿o bind the Bark gently upon it, but not juÅ¿t upon the Bud: This is the common way uÅ¿ed by Gardiners.</p>
                     <p>Â§. 5. Others make the croÅ¿s-cut in the middle of the downright Å¿core on the Stock, and lifting up the four corners of the Bark, and making the Cyen Å¿harp at both ends, put it under the Bark of the Stock at both ends, and then bind it; but in doing this, there is danger of hurting the Bud or Cyen.</p>
                     <p>Â§. 6. Mr. <hi>Rea</hi> commends the making the croÅ¿s-cut at the lower end of the downright cut, and having opened the Å¿ides, put in the Cyen upwards, being made Å¿harp at the upper end only.</p>
                     <p>You muÅ¿t be nimble and quick in Inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating, and preparing the Bud, els the Air by Å¿udden drying the Bud or Cyen and the cut part of the Stock will much be hurt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="56" facs="tcp:154132:37"/>Thus much to Å¿atisfy the curioÅ¿ity of Å¿uch as have a mind to make tryal of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way, but the firÅ¿t is eÅ¿teemed beÅ¿t.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">NeceÅ¿Å¿ary rules and obÅ¿ervations on Inocula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note>Â§. 7. LeÅ¿t one Bud fail, or any miÅ¿chance break it, put two in every Stock, but not directly under one another on the Å¿ame Å¿ide of the Stock. The Branch or Shoot, you cut one Cyen off may yield you Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral.</p>
                     <p>Â§. 8. About a Month after the Inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating, or Å¿ooner if you perceive the Bark Å¿well where the binding is, cut off the binding.</p>
                     <p>If it grow it will fix to the Stock, keep it's colour, and that part of the Leaf and Stalk that was left, will drop off, and the Bud appear fair; Then Å¿ometime before the next Spring, cut off the top of the Stock a hands breath above the place it was Inoculated at, and all the Å¿ide-branches that grow any where upon the Stock; and at Spring the Bud will put forth; and if any other Sprouts or Buds appear on the Stock, cut them off.</p>
                     <p>Â§. 9. If the firÅ¿t Inoculation fail, or the Buds dye, the Stocks may be Inoculated again the next Summer, and of Å¿uch as are Inoculated timely in the year, it may be Å¿ometimes Å¿een whether they grow or not,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:154132:37"/>time enough to Inoculate them again the Å¿ame year.</p>
                     <p>Â§. 10. Apricocks will have Buds ready Å¿ooner than other Fruit, Å¿o that you may begin with them and follow with the other.</p>
                     <p>Â§. 11. Stocks raiÅ¿ed of Peach-Å¿tones are commonly big enough to be Inoculated the Å¿econd Summer, Å¿ometimes the FirÅ¿t after they are Å¿et: when they or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther stocks are an Inch and half in compaÅ¿s, or thereabouts, they are big enough to be Inoculated.</p>
                     <p>Â§. 12. ThoÅ¿e you intend for Wall or Dwarf-trees, are to be Inoculated within a handfull of the ground, and not Pruned at all, till you remove them, and then you will better Å¿ee whats neceÅ¿Å¿ary to be cut off; and theÅ¿e you may remove after one years growth, or two, with more Å¿afety.</p>
                     <p>If you Inoculate any Plums, Pears, Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or other Fruit, that you intend for an Orchard, or other place for tall Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dards, you may do it higher on the Stocks, <hi>viz.</hi> Å¿ix or Å¿even foot high, and Prune theÅ¿e up in the NurÅ¿ery, and let them grow there, two or three years (according as
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:154132:38"/>they grow in hight) before they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.</p>
                     <p>Â§. 13. After Stocks that are Inoculated have made one or two years growth, you muÅ¿t cut off the head of the Stock, that remain'd above the Bud: At your firÅ¿t cutting it, cut it cloÅ¿e to the new Branches, that it may grow over the cut; let it be cut a little Å¿lope, and Clay'd over, if you deÅ¿ire the Branch Å¿hould quickly cover it; and the Å¿ooner it doth the better.</p>
                     <p>Â§. 14. Care muÅ¿t be had in chooÅ¿ing Branches or Shoots from which you are to have your Buds, that they be of Shoots of the Å¿ame years growth you Inoculate; and of Å¿trong growth, the Bark firm, and not Å¿pungy; Å¿uffer them to fade as little as may be before you uÅ¿e them; and the Shoots muÅ¿t be got from Trees that your own or others experience can faithfully aÅ¿Å¿ure you not only to be good Fruit, but very good bearers; and if the Fruit you deÅ¿ign to raiÅ¿e, be at Å¿uch a diÅ¿tance that you cannot have Buds to Inoculate the Å¿ame day they are cut, put them in wet MoÅ¿s or GraÅ¿s in a Box, and Å¿o they will keep a day and a night very well. But if by carriage in the Air or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiÅ¿e they are a little withered, you may revive them by Å¿etting them in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:154132:38"/>which will make the Buds come clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner from the Wood.</p>
                     <p>Â§. 15. Nectarins, Peaches, and Apri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks are Å¿eldom raiÅ¿ed otherwiÅ¿e than by Inoculation; becauÅ¿e they will rarely or never grow by Grafting; but Pears, Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or Plums take and grow full as well by Grafting as Inoculation. The Bark of Cyens taken from Å¿ome Plums, is Å¿o ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Å¿pungy they will often miÅ¿carry when Inoculated: Å¿uch one be Å¿ure to raiÅ¿e rather by Grafting, tho many Plums will hit very well being Inoculated.</p>
                     <p>Cyens of Apples fail for the moÅ¿t part, when you Inoculate Buds of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e their Bark is tender, and Buds weak.</p>
                     <p>Cherries and Pears take very Å¿ure being Inoculated on young freÅ¿h Stocks, whoÅ¿e Bark is not very thick.</p>
                     <p>Â§. 16. Upon conÅ¿ideration of all, I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viÅ¿e the Planter to raiÅ¿e all his Fruit-trees by Grafting, as being both the Å¿ureÅ¿t and eaÅ¿ieÅ¿t way; only his Peaches, Nectarins, and Apricocks can be propagated only by Inoculating; yet where Inoculating Å¿uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds well, it's eÅ¿teemed and prefer'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Grafting, for the following reaÅ¿ons. 1. BecauÅ¿e the Stock will be big enough to Inoculate by two or three years Å¿ooner than to Graft, and your Plant groweth much
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:154132:39"/>faÅ¿ter after the nature is Å¿o alter'd than it did before, and will be Å¿ooner ready to tranÅ¿plant than if it be Å¿uffer'd to grow two or three years longer, as it muÅ¿t be before it be ready to be Grafted. 2. It makes a Å¿ounder Tree than one that is Grafted, eÅ¿pecially in the Cleft; becauÅ¿e it covereth the Stock Å¿peedily and well. 3. It hurts not the Stock Å¿o much as Graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and if it chance to fail, it may be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculated next year again, and Å¿ometimes the Å¿ame year. 4. Some look upon In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculating to be more Å¿peedy, eaÅ¿y and delightÅ¿ome than Grafting, and may be practiÅ¿ed by Gentlemen, who in <hi>June</hi> may lye on the ground and do it; whereof they cannot Å¿o well bear the cold without danger of taking hurt in <hi>February,</hi> or <hi>March,</hi> which is the choice of Grafting Å¿ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on.</p>
                     <p>If you do Inoculate any Buds of Pear, Cherry, or Plum, let the Shoots be very Å¿trong and large, but you had better Graft them.</p>
                     <p>Â§. 17. Not only the Pith, but alÅ¿o the Wood of the Bud is caÅ¿t away in Inoculating, and nothing made uÅ¿e of but the Buds and Bark of any young Shoot, and yet they bring forth the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:154132:39"/>Å¿ame Fruit as the Tree whence they are got.</p>
                     <p>Â§. 18. It's debated among Planters what time of the day is beÅ¿t for Inoculating;<note place="margin">Time of the day to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculate.</note> Å¿ome perÅ¿ons argue Å¿tiffly for the morning; becauÅ¿e there paÅ¿leth up much more Sap or juice in the day-time than in the night, as they obÅ¿erve in piercing the Birch-Tree, and other Trees to get the liquor out of them for PhyÅ¿ical uÅ¿es; and conÅ¿equently the Bud Inoculated in the morning, muÅ¿t be more likely to grow, having the whole days plenty of Sap to invite it to unite with the Stock, than if it be Inoculated late in the day, and Å¿o muÅ¿t be diÅ¿couraged in it's new habitation by the niggardly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viÅ¿ion of the nights Sap.</p>
                     <p>If you follow this advice, you had beÅ¿t wrap Å¿ome broad Leaves or Fern about the Stock; Å¿o as to Å¿hade the Cyen from the Scorching heat of the day following, to prevent it's drying before the Stock hath undertaken the charge of preÅ¿erving it.</p>
                     <p>But this work may be done in the heat of the day, if the heat be not violent, and then you muÅ¿t (as at all times you ought) be very quick in the doing of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="62" facs="tcp:154132:40"/>And for all that hath been Å¿aid before, the afternoon may be as good a time as any; becauÅ¿e if the Bud have leÅ¿s liquor afforded it in the night, then the cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s of that time makes it leÅ¿s thirÅ¿ty; and as it's thirÅ¿t encreaÅ¿eth by the heat of the next day, a more plentiful Stream will be very Å¿eaÅ¿onable to Å¿atisfy it.</p>

                     <p>Â§. 1. AFter Grafts have had their full growth the firÅ¿t year, they muÅ¿t be Pruned, Å¿uch as need it; ThoÅ¿e that are Grafted low and yet muÅ¿t be made Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dards, or tall Trees, leave only one Shoot, the Å¿trongeÅ¿t and biggeÅ¿t, and let not that Shoot begin to Å¿pread untill it be Å¿even foot high at leaÅ¿t; therefore cut off all the Å¿ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branches, till they are grown to the hight you deÅ¿ire. If to Å¿pred low, let Å¿ome be left on each Å¿ide, that the boughs on any one Å¿ide may grow Å¿traight upright. As for Wall-plants it's no matter of how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Branches they Å¿pread, the more the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Now unleÅ¿s young Grafts put forth a Å¿trong and luÅ¿ty Shoot, Prune not off all the Å¿ide-branches, leÅ¿t the body of the Plant be too Å¿mall and limber to bear his head; therefore if the body be very Å¿lender Å¿uffer Å¿ome of the Å¿ide-twigs to grow, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the Body be of a Å¿ufficient Å¿trength to bear the top, and from year to year Prune off thoÅ¿e Shoots and Branches as are Å¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:154132:41"/>and grow too near one another, interfere, fret and gall each other, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erve only Å¿uch as are fit to make the Tree of a comly form; and Å¿uffer them not the firÅ¿t three years (at leaÅ¿t) to grow thick and buÅ¿hy-headed, by cutting off Å¿ome of the inÅ¿ide-Å¿hoots, and Å¿uch as grow croÅ¿s one another, or pendent.</p>
                     <p>Â§. 2. What you cut off the Body, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Branch, do it cloÅ¿e and even, that the Bark may grow over it.</p>
                     <p>Â§. 3. If you cut part of any Shoot, or of a Cyen for Grafting, cut it cloÅ¿e at a Bud, that the cut may be cover'd with a freÅ¿h Sprig, and the wound may again grow up, and a Stub-end not be left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind.</p>
                     <p>Â§. 4. At what hight Å¿oever, or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oever you would have the Tree, or any Branch, or Shoot to Å¿pread, there top it, that is cut off a Bud, an Inch of the very top cloÅ¿e at a Bud, and there it will Å¿pread.</p>
                     <p>Â§. 5. When Trees grow big that a Knife will not Prune them, uÅ¿e the broad ChiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el (mention'd in <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2.) with which, and a Mallet, you may take off a Bough or large Branch, as you will, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either hurting the Bark of the Tree, by cutting too near, or leaving a Stump,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:154132:41"/>by not cutting near enough; one of which is not eaÅ¿ily avoided by the chance blows of an Ax, or Hatchet, and being amongÅ¿t thick boughs your ChiÅ¿el and Mallet will be more governable than other InÅ¿tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; If the boughs are very large you may uÅ¿e a Saw firÅ¿t, and then Å¿mooth it with the ChiÅ¿el.</p>
                     <p>Â§. 6. Trees growing in Orchards, Fields, or Hedges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> muÅ¿t be Pruned from year to year as need is, in <hi>November,</hi> or <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> by cutting off Å¿uperfluous Branches and Å¿uch as croÅ¿s one another, and grow too cloÅ¿e; leave no dead Twigs or Branches, and Å¿crape off the MoÅ¿s on the body, or Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Tree.</p>

                     <p>Â§. 8.

                           <item>4. Fruits are more eaÅ¿ily gather'd from a low than a tall Tree, beating or Å¿haking down Fruit from Å¿uch Trees being to be rejected by all judicious CyderiÅ¿ts.</item>
                           <item>5. Any Fruit on a low well Å¿pread Tree, is better and fairer than that on a tall Tree, by the Å¿ame reaÅ¿on that the Tree is fairer, becauÅ¿e the Sap is not Å¿o much waÅ¿ted in the low and humble Tree, as in the tall and lofty by its large Trunck.</item>

                     <p>NotwithÅ¿tanding theÅ¿e reaÅ¿ons Å¿eem plauÅ¿ible, yet experience aÅ¿Å¿ures, that a Tree of a reaÅ¿onable height (I mean not high like Tymber Trees) bears as well as the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:154132:42"/>and if you obÅ¿erve a due diÅ¿tance, which ought to be, the Å¿hade will not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious; and tho Fruit on a low Tree is eaÅ¿ily gathered, yet the other may be with Å¿ome little pains gathered well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
                     <p>But if you deÅ¿ign to uÅ¿e the Land under, or about the Trees you plant, either in Orchard, Field, or Hedg, for the Syth, Spade, or GraÅ¿ing of Cattle eÅ¿pecially, let your Trees be Å¿even foot high at leaÅ¿t be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they begin to Å¿pread, becauÅ¿e you can Å¿carce Å¿o cautiouÅ¿ly preÅ¿erve them, but Cattle will Å¿omtime or other get into your Orchard, and then they will not a little endamage your Fruit-trees, if low, by nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping off the Buds of all boughs within their reach; and if you chance to farm the Orchard, your Tenants in deÅ¿pight of all Covenants to the contrary, will either be negligent, malitious, or Å¿o covetous as to permit Cattel to Graze in the Orchard, to your no little damage, which by letting them be Å¿even foot high before they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to Å¿pread, will be infallibly prevented.

In Pruning Trees be cautious of cutting off the Å¿mall Sprigs, which are the more apt to bear Fruit, it being too uÅ¿ual for ignorant Planters, to beautify their Trees, by taking off theÅ¿e Å¿uperfluous branches (as they term them) whereby they deprive themÅ¿elves of the Furit.</p>
                     <p>Â§. 11. Cherry-trees muÅ¿t be Grafted at the hight you would have them Å¿pread, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Å¿ix or Å¿even Foot high, unleÅ¿s for the Wall, and then within a Foot of the ground.</p>
                     <p>Â§. 12. Prune the Heads of Å¿ome Å¿ort of Trees that have but Å¿mall Pith as Apple-trees, Pear-trees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when you remove them, to proportion the Branch and Root as near as you can; but Cherry-trees, Plum-trees, Walnut-trees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that have a large Pith are not to be top't, only Å¿ome of the Å¿ide Branches may be taken away.</p>

THe diÅ¿tance of Trees in Orchards ought not to be leÅ¿s than eight Yards, neither need it be more than 13, or 14; the richer the Land is, the greater diÅ¿tance you ought to Å¿et the Trees at from one another, to which you ought to have reÅ¿pect, and alÅ¿o to the kinds of Fruit-trees you plant; for Å¿ome Trees take up more room than others, as moÅ¿t Apple-trees more than Pear-trees, and Å¿ome Apple-trees more than others, according to their aptneÅ¿s to grow more or leÅ¿s, too tedious and difficult to be here related; only the Red-Å¿treak be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Generally a deÅ¿ired Fruit, you may take notice that it's one of the leaÅ¿t Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-trees; where it yields the beÅ¿t Cyder, Å¿omtimes it's almoÅ¿t but a Shrub, the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Pear-main, Golden-renating, and John-apple, are Trees that Å¿pread not much, but the Gregory-pippin, a Fruit-Tree in <hi>LancaÅ¿hire,</hi> is a mighty Å¿preader, even on courÅ¿e Land, grows well and quickly, and

                        <note place="margin">Cherry and Codling Hedge diÅ¿tances.</note>Â§. 3. Of late times it's uÅ¿ed to make Cherry-hedges in Gardens and Orchards, and Hedges of Codlings, NurÅ¿-gardens, Plums, and Å¿uch like Trees that may be kept by cutting and plaiÅ¿hing one Branch within another, and from growing very large; theÅ¿e are uÅ¿ually made along the Å¿ide of Walks, or round about a Garden-plot, and are Ornamental to a Garden be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ordered and kept handÅ¿omly.</p>
                     <p>Trees for theÅ¿e purpoÅ¿es are to be Å¿et about a yard, or an ell aÅ¿under; for they Å¿hould near meet the firÅ¿t year, and Å¿hould be thus ordered, <hi>viz.</hi> Å¿tretch a line from one end to the other where the Hedg is to be made, and Å¿et the Trees Å¿traight at the diÅ¿tance aforeÅ¿aid: Afterwards knock down a Stake betwixt each Tree, then having Å¿traight long Rods, or Poles of AÅ¿h, or the

                        <note place="margin">ReaÅ¿ons for a large diÅ¿tance in Å¿etting Trees.</note>Â§. 4. For many reÅ¿pects Trees ought to be planted at a large diÅ¿tance, eÅ¿pecially for the following reaÅ¿ons.
<list>
                           <item>1. The Plantation will be little Annoyance to the Land, if either you Å¿et GooÅ¿-berries, Currens, Ras-berries, Straw-berries, or Garden Å¿tuff in it; Å¿ow Corn on it while the Trees are young, or graze it when they are grown up.</item>
                           <item>2. Whereas Å¿ome Å¿ay the more Trees the more Fruit; that's abÅ¿olutely falÅ¿e; for when they are Å¿et Å¿o cloÅ¿e, that the Sun can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have a good influence on them, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freÅ¿hing the Roots, Body, Branches, BloÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oms and Fruits, they bear poorly, and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:154132:45"/>ripen worÅ¿e; and cloÅ¿e-Å¿et Trees in a few years when they Å¿hould bear Fruits, croud, fret, and gall one another, and by rubbing often cauÅ¿e the Canker.</item>
                           <item>3. They cannot grow to be Trees of that Å¿ize as they would (if the Land be good) being Å¿et at a good diÅ¿tance, and Å¿ome kind of Trees being of Å¿tronger and Å¿wifter growth than others, will Å¿o domineer over their neighbors, that they will make them almoÅ¿t good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and one Tree that is Å¿et at a fair diÅ¿tance will bear oftner, and more Fruit than three, or four Trees Å¿et cloÅ¿e, as is dayly Å¿een by Å¿ome Apple-trees that grow Å¿ingle, or in a Hedge.</item>
                           <item>4. You may Plant betwixt every Tree, a Cherry-tree, Plum-tree, or Codling-tree, which may grow up and bear with the other Trees many years, and never reach or Prejudice them, but will decay before the others are at full growth; Or you may Å¿et a young Apple-tree, or Pear-tree betwixt every two of your Standards that you Å¿et in the Orchard, and nurÅ¿e it up with neceÅ¿Å¿ary dreÅ¿Å¿ing and Pruning Å¿even or eight years, or leÅ¿s time, to tranÅ¿plant into Fields or PaÅ¿ture-land, where Cattle feed; whereby with little help it will not be in Å¿uch danger of hurt from Cattel as Å¿mall ones would, and bear Fruit Å¿oon after it's Å¿et, and you cannot let them grow Å¿o long in your NurÅ¿ery without galling, fretting, or hurting one
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:154132:45"/>another, unleÅ¿s when you remove Trees out of your NurÅ¿ery, you take care to leave every other Tree, whereby they may have liberty to grow big, and Å¿o more fit for your Fields.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for Standard Cherry-trees, Plum-trees, and the like, Å¿ix yards diÅ¿tance is the moÅ¿t convenient, unleÅ¿s the ground be exceeding rich, and then a greater diÅ¿tance, as Å¿even or eight yards aÅ¿under.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Choice of Ground for an Orchard, and the ordering it.</head>
                     <p>SO far as it lyeth in ones power to chooÅ¿e a plot of Ground for an Orch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, let it be done with reÅ¿pect to the following advantages</p>
                     <p>Â§. 1. It Å¿hould lye conveniently near him, declining and lying open towards the South, South-eaÅ¿t, or South-weÅ¿t, and defended from the North, North-eaÅ¿t, and North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weÅ¿t Winds by buildings, Woods, or high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Grounds; the Land Å¿hould rather incline to dryneÅ¿s than moiÅ¿ture, without Springs, the Soyl deep and a fat Earth, not a Å¿tiff, cold Clay, or binding Gravel, nor a light, Å¿andy, esky or hollow Earth; yet with good Husbandry, if it run not into the extreams of any of theÅ¿e, Fruit-trees may proÅ¿per reaÅ¿onably well in it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="75" facs="tcp:154132:46"/>Â§. 2. The natural Soil for an Orchard is more to be reÅ¿pected than a Garden; for the Garden Fruit-trees, and what els groweth there, rooteth little deeper than it may be eaÅ¿ily manured; but Pear-trees and Apple-trees in Orchards Å¿hould grow to be large Trees, and therefore Å¿end forth Roots broad and deep, Å¿o that it tranÅ¿cends all coÅ¿t and pains to enrich the Ground for them, as far as the Roots every way reach.</p>
                     <p>Â§. 3. But they that are Å¿eated or fixed in any place, and cannot conveniently change their habitation, muÅ¿t be content with their own, and if any defect or diÅ¿advantage be in it, it may be it hath Å¿ome advantage that another wants, if it lye to the North, the Trees Bud and BloÅ¿Å¿om the later, and many times the Fruit thereby Å¿ucceeds the better, and is free from the injurious South-winds in the Autumnal Å¿eaÅ¿on.</p>
                     <p>Â§. 4. If it lye to the EaÅ¿t, it hath not only the advantage of being later Budded, and blown, becauÅ¿e of the cold EaÅ¿terly Winds in the Spring, but the Fruit ripens the better, the morning Sun in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer being by much the beÅ¿t, and the Fruits freed from the WeÅ¿tern Winds, which with the South are the worÅ¿t.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="76" facs="tcp:154132:47"/>Â§. 5. If your Land be on a dry, or riÅ¿ing Ground, you may Plant them the thicker, which will cover and Å¿hade the Ground the Å¿ooner, and make them bear the better; the Fruit will alÅ¿o yield a more vinous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor.</p>
                     <p>Â§. 6. If your Ground lye in a cold moiÅ¿t Vale, the Å¿ooner may you raiÅ¿e a natural Fence about it, to defend your Trees from cold Winds, and Å¿tiff GuÅ¿ts, which diverÅ¿ly anoy your Trees and Fruits; and I once knew a perÅ¿on that had a cold moiÅ¿t flat Å¿pringey plot of Ground, who cauÅ¿ed double Ditches to be made therein, at ten yards diÅ¿tance, each from other, and about an Ell high; upon theÅ¿e Ditches he planted Apple-trees each ten yards diÅ¿tant from another, which Trees did grow, proÅ¿per, and bear exceeding well.</p>
                     <p>Â§. 7. But if you have liberty to chooÅ¿e what Land you will for Planting of Fruit-trees, obÅ¿erve the directions given in the firÅ¿t <hi>Section</hi> of this <hi>Chap.</hi> and chooÅ¿e a warm, light Rye-land, or either a black or brown mold, if with a mixture of Sand, Å¿o much the better, but the heavy cold and moiÅ¿t Wheat-land is not Å¿o good.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="77" facs="tcp:154132:47"/>Â§. 8. If the Ground be very light and rich of it felf, or Å¿o made by improvement, Å¿everal Å¿orts of Apple-trees, eÅ¿pecially the Pippin, will be Å¿o apt to canker, that they will Å¿carce ever be large Trees; therefore a firm and Å¿trong Land; is beÅ¿t for Winter or long laÅ¿ting Fruit; but for Summer-fruit, Land cannot be too light; the more it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines to redneÅ¿s the better.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">How to qualify the Ground.</note>Â§. 9. If the Land you intend for it be a Turf or Green-Å¿ward, you ought to Plow it two years before you Å¿et your Trees in it, to make it mellow and looÅ¿e, that the Trees may be better take Root, and you may then lay on Manure, which by Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will be well mixt with the natural Soil, and uÅ¿e Å¿uch Manure as will beÅ¿t Å¿uit to amend it; and if you Å¿ow the Ground a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ten days after the MidÅ¿ummur before you Plant, with Turneps, and when they are got off, which will be about <hi>November,</hi> if you pleaÅ¿e, then Å¿et your Trees, they will like well.</p>
                     <p>Â§. 10. Where the natural Soil is not good of it Å¿elf, whether it be in Garden, Orchard, or Field, there it ought to be by skill aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿ted and better'd, at leaÅ¿t wiÅ¿e for Å¿uch a compaÅ¿s as the Roots of every Tree take up for Å¿ome time, if not Å¿o far round as they are ever like to extend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="78" facs="tcp:154132:48"/>And this muÅ¿t be done by mixing Å¿uch Manures with the Soil as Å¿uit beÅ¿t with it's temper. If the Soil be Clay, or Clay mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Gravel or wet heavy Land, hot Dung, as that of HorÅ¿es, or Poultry, or for want of that, of Oxen or Cows is beÅ¿t to mix with it, to bring it to a due tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament.</p>
                     <p>And if the Soil be light, hollow, esky, or Å¿andy Land; Marl, Mud out of a Pond, Ditch, or River, or Å¿hovelings of Dirty yards or Highways, if they be not Sandy, and be well Mellowed, by lying on heaps, and eÅ¿pecially if thoÅ¿e heaps are mixed with Lime, are proper to mend it.</p>
                     <p>If this laÅ¿t Soil be barren likewiÅ¿e, you may properly add a mixture of Neats Dung.</p>
                     <p>It hath been Å¿een that an Apple-tree on a Hemp-but, which was conÅ¿tantly Plowed, and Manured to a great richneÅ¿s, bore more Apples than four Å¿uch Trees in an Orchard would do; and it's conÅ¿tantly Å¿een in Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren hungry Land, Trees thrive poorly, grow MoÅ¿Å¿ey, or Bark-bound, bearing Å¿el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and that a poor Fruit: Only Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut-trees and Pear-trees do not neceÅ¿Å¿arily require a very rich Ground, and will proÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per beÅ¿t on Stony, and light Land.</p>
                     <p>If your Land be too rich (which is Å¿el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom Å¿een) you may mix Coal-aÅ¿hes with it.</p>
                     <p>

                        <note place="margin">MoiÅ¿t Land to order.</note>Â§. 11. If your Land is very flat, that wet is apt to Å¿tand upon it, or be a Å¿hallow Soil, you may Å¿omthing help it in Plowing, alÅ¿o by gathering the Land always up in and near the place where you intend the Rows of Trees Å¿hall afterwards Å¿tand, which in two years time will Å¿omthing raiÅ¿e it, and thicken the Soil, and the Furrows Å¿o made will help to carry off the Water, or which is better, raiÅ¿e the Land on broad Ridges, that the middle of them may be about 24, or 30 Foot diÅ¿tance, according as you intend to Plant your Trees: Let the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals between the Ridges be about eight Foot broad, and the Earth taken up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween, about a Foot deep, and caÅ¿t on the Ridges which will make the Ground thicker of the beÅ¿t Soil than before it was, that the Roots of the Trees you Plant on the Ridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es cannot run down, nor Å¿pread into the bad Soil, which otherwiÅ¿e it would do; by this means the Trees will thrive and proÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per well, as may be perceived on the Banks of Å¿ome Land, and the Hedges, that Apple-trees will thrive better there than on the Level-land.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">MoiÅ¿t Land to order.</note>Â§. 12. If it be a Springey moiÅ¿t or Å¿pewy Land, you muÅ¿t Trench it at the head of the Spring, and that deeper than the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of the Spring runs in the Earth, which you may leave open, and yearly cleanÅ¿e, or fill it up with Alder or Oler-boughs, and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:154132:49"/>cover them with the Turf and Earth that came forth, much higher than the other Land; for the Wood and looÅ¿e Earth will Å¿ink very much by degrees; or you may dig Å¿everal narrow Trenches, one between each Row of Trees, deÅ¿cending to Å¿ome Ditch at the lower end of your Ground, and lay in the bottom of it Alder-frith, or Fag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots of Beech, and fill the Trenches again on the Å¿aid Frith or Faggots with Earth, as aforeÅ¿aid, and the Water will inÅ¿inuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly paÅ¿s through the Å¿aid Wood to the lower Å¿ide of the Ground, leaving the reÅ¿t dryer; but if you cannot eaÅ¿ily do this, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it as at the foregoing <hi>Section.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Â§. 13. If it be Springey, but only lye Å¿o low and flat that in the Winter Rain or Land-floods will lye upon it, and that it hath been lately Plowed, or that you'l not loÅ¿e two years time by Plowing it before you Å¿et your Trees, or if it be Å¿hallow or ebb Soil, you may Å¿et your Trees by Tump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Hot dry Land to order.</note>Â§. 14. If your Ground be a hot dry San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Å¿hallow Land, Marl laid on the Å¿urface and there Å¿pread, will cool, Å¿adden, and make it rich; or if you can, cauÅ¿e the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of Å¿ome Rill of Water, or rather Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that runs from Pools, Ponds, or Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hills, to over flow it Å¿omtimes, which will
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:154132:49"/>not only moiÅ¿ten, but make the Ground fertile alÅ¿o, and the Trees proÅ¿per well.</p>
                     <p>Fern or any other vegetables, nay Stones covering Å¿uch Land, will preÅ¿erve it cool and moiÅ¿t.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Gravelly-ground to order.</note>Â§. 15. Gravel-grounds are as bad as any; becauÅ¿e a Tree in them cannot Root to any great bigneÅ¿s; and if Muck, or other Soils be laid to the Roots of Trees in Å¿uch Land, the Gravel will in a few years eat it up, and convert it unto it's own nature; but if a little Stony, a mixture of Mold among the Stones, and at the digging to pick our the largeÅ¿t Stones, then Trees will Root indifferent well in Å¿uch Grounds.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Over-flown Land.</note>Â§. 16. If Land be Å¿ubject to be over-flown by the inundation of Rivers, or other falls of Water, Å¿o as the Water Å¿tand not too long upon it, nor the Land be of a Å¿tiff cold nature, it's very good for Fruit-trees.</p>

IN removing any big Tree, men generally obÅ¿erve to CoaÅ¿t them, that is, to place the Å¿ame Å¿ide of the Tree to the South-EaÅ¿t, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as grew formerly that way where it Å¿tood before; to which end before you remove it, you had beÅ¿t make Å¿ome mark in the Bark of the Tree which way it Å¿tood, this you may obÅ¿erve in Å¿traight Trees, but it's more material if your Trees lean one way more than an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, to Å¿et the leaning Å¿ide towards the South-weÅ¿t, from whence the Å¿trongeÅ¿t Winds blow; but notwithÅ¿tanding this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ervation, you need not mind it in Å¿mall Trees, or Å¿uch that have grown in cloÅ¿e-NurÅ¿eries; they not being capable of any conÅ¿iderable alteration from any AÅ¿pect of the Heavens.</p>
                     <p>In caÅ¿e a Tree before removal hath the benefit of the EaÅ¿t, or WeÅ¿t Sun, more than of the South, then Plant that Tree that before had that advantage, on the like
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:154132:55"/>again in it's new place, which altho it va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from the directions aforeÅ¿aid, yet not from the reaÅ¿on of it.</p>

                        <note place="margin">How to take up Trees to be TranÅ¿plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note>Â§. 2. Be carefull in taking up the Plants; dig round about them, and take off the Mold from their Roots; if it be a Å¿mall Plant, it may be drawn up eaÅ¿ily, the Mold being taken away, if it be great, and the Roots Å¿pread much, then they may be cut about half a yard from the body of the Plant, and the greater it is, the further off cut the Roots, and Å¿o draw it up; but keep the Spade from coming too near the Tree, by Å¿urrounding the Tree at a good diÅ¿tance, and endeavour to raiÅ¿e as much Earth as you can with the Tree, but if it be to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry far, Å¿hake it off; then pick off all the Leaves, if they be not fallen off, becauÅ¿e the Sun and Air by their means extract the Sap out of the Branches.</p>
                     <p>Pear-trees have ordinarily more brittle Roots than Apple-trees, and the Roots of Apple-trees, or Stocks, raiÅ¿ed of the Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels of good Fruit, are more brittel than thoÅ¿e raiÅ¿ed of Crab or wilding Kernels; therefore take more care and pains in open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ground deeper and wider, when you take up the more tender and brittle Root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Plants, and pull not over hard, leÅ¿t you leave moÅ¿t of the Roots behind.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Young Trees beÅ¿t to Å¿et.</note>Â§. 3. Young Trees of three or four years old at moÅ¿t when removed, do not only grow Å¿urer, but make a larger growth at firÅ¿t Planting, than greater and elder Trees can do, and are therefore beÅ¿t to tranÅ¿plant.</p>
                     <p>Â§. 4. If your Trees have lain Å¿ome time out of the Ground, or been carried in the Wind or FroÅ¿ts, that their Roots Å¿eem to be dry, Å¿et them over night in Water, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merging only the Roots, and it will very much revive them; or when you Plant them, after you have added an indifferent quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Earth, caÅ¿t in a Pail or more of Water as the largneÅ¿s of the FoÅ¿s or hole requires, which not only quickens the Roots, but makes the Earth adhere there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, which otherwiÅ¿e would lye light and hollow about them.

Take heed of Å¿etting the Roots of your Plants too deep below the good Soil, for if Å¿et Å¿hallow they proÅ¿per far better, than Å¿uch as are Å¿et deep; becauÅ¿e in the top of the Earth is the beÅ¿t Mold, Å¿o made by the Suns influence thereon, and every Å¿hower of Rain reaches, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freÅ¿hes, and feeds the Roots: for all may eaÅ¿ily obÅ¿erve Trees thrive beÅ¿t where the Roots run near the Surface, and not at all where Planted deep; becauÅ¿e by deep Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they thruÅ¿t down their Roots below the good Soil into that which is barren and unfruitful; which cauÅ¿es your Trees to be injured by Canker, MoÅ¿s, and to be bad bearers, and ill thrivers.</p>

If the Tree be young, and the Roots Å¿lender, this can be performed no way but by throwing in a little Soil at a time, and then raiÅ¿ing up with your hands Å¿uch Roots as are preÅ¿Å¿ed down by it below their proper Å¿ituation, Å¿preading them on the Soil you have caÅ¿t in, and then throwing in more, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Roots as before, Å¿o continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to do till you have fill'd up the hole.</p>
                     <p>Old Trees with Å¿turdy Roots require not Å¿o much curioÅ¿ity, but be Å¿ure that the Mold lye cloÅ¿e under, betwixt, and among the Roots.</p>
                     <p>If the Soil be light, preÅ¿s it down gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with your foot; then cover them half a yard about with Straw, Weeds, Litter, Fern, or the like, which will keep the Roots warm all Winter, and moiÅ¿t and cool in the following Summer; but if your Ground
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:154132:58"/>be not very rich, cover the top about the Tree with Dung.</p>
                     <p>Note that Dung is not good to lay next the Roots of your Trees, unleÅ¿s it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to Mold by it's long lying and rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneÅ¿s, but Dung is better, being mixed with the Earth laid next the Roots of Trees than alone.</p>

                     <p>If you are enforced to remove a Tree in Summer, take the Earth you digged out of the FoÅ¿s or hole you intend to Plant your Tree in, and mix and temper it well with an equal quantity of Cow-dung, and as much water as will make it into a Liquid pap; fill the hole almoÅ¿t with this, and let the Root of the Tree gently Å¿ink in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it; cover it over with the Mold, and lay Å¿ome Fern or Litter over all, and once a Month water it, and it will grow well.</p>

                     <p>The Winter Pruning is chiefly for the well ordering of the Branches, that could not be well placed in Summer time, and for the Cutting off great Branches when need is. PreÅ¿erve Branches as low, and as near the Ground as may be, and cauÅ¿e them to bend and grow Å¿traight along the Å¿ides of the Wall both ways, and Å¿uffer not the biggeÅ¿t Branches to riÅ¿e Å¿traight upward, but nail them down-wards, to furniÅ¿h the bottom of the Wall. Be Å¿ure to take off thoÅ¿e that grow the Å¿traighteÅ¿t out, and will not be bowed cloÅ¿e to the Wall. And ObÅ¿erve to bend down the Å¿trongeÅ¿t Shoots (that would grow upwards) towards the Å¿ides, otherwiÅ¿e they will be apt to run Å¿traight upward and not cover the Å¿pace you deÅ¿ign for them, and by their Luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous growth will extreamly rob the Å¿ide-Branches of their nouriÅ¿hment; there will Branches enough Å¿pring out freÅ¿h to run upwards out of them, when they are Å¿o bowed.</p>
                     <p>ThoÅ¿e that Å¿uffer all the young and larg Shoots, to grow as much as they will all Summer, without Cutting, and then in Winter Cut all or moÅ¿t of them quite off from the Trees, and preÅ¿erve only the old Å¿tumps, or biggeÅ¿t Branches of the Tree,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:154132:62"/>do commit a great errour; becauÅ¿e thereby in the middle part of the Tree, and near the Root, few or no young Branches will be Å¿een, whereas they Å¿hould preÅ¿erve all the young Branches to Å¿pread up againÅ¿t the Wall untill it be full of Å¿mall Boughs, and then Å¿ome young Shoots every year may be Cut off.</p>

                        <note place="margin">To renew Old Trees</note>Â§. 4. When your Wall-Trees are grown old and full of big Wood, you may in three or four years time renew them, by Cutting out Å¿ome of the biggeÅ¿t Stems or Boughs yearly, cutting each Branch off at Å¿ome Å¿mall twig (if it may be) that either it, or a freÅ¿h Branch may grow over the cut place, which muÅ¿t be kept cover'd with Clay, and Å¿o go on yearly till all the big Wood is cut out.

                     <p>By either of theÅ¿e ways you may renew a decaying Tree, and keep your Wall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moÅ¿t Å¿till furniÅ¿hed, with leÅ¿s trouble and charge, or loÅ¿s of Time, than by taking up the old one, and Planting a young one in its Å¿tead.</p>

In furniÅ¿hing your Walls with Fruit-Trees, ObÅ¿erve always to Plant Peaches and Nectarines up to the Wall that is moÅ¿t Southward; the EaÅ¿t-Wall is to be allotted to Apricocks, early Cherries, and the choiceÅ¿t Plums; the WeÅ¿t may be Å¿et with Pears, Cherries, and Plums. Some of the courÅ¿eÅ¿t Pears and Plums, you may Å¿et to the North-Wall, both to cover the Wall handÅ¿omely, and many years they will bear as well on it, as on Standards; eÅ¿peci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if your Wall Å¿tand not directly North, but Å¿o as to have Å¿ome conÅ¿iderable benefit of the Sun, Nut-Trees likewiÅ¿e are proper for this Wall, and will proÅ¿per well up to it.</p>
                     <p>If your conveniencies will allow it, and you are to build a new Wall, it is much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to have your Garden Walls not Å¿tand directly towards the four points, than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiÅ¿e, and then the worÅ¿t Wall will be much better, and the beÅ¿t good enough for your purpoÅ¿e.</p>

                     <p>One in a cold Countrey having his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-Walls thus made, had his Trees bear Fruit plentifully in Å¿uch years as his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours generally fail.</p>

                     <p>Grapes ripen delicately on every Å¿ide the CluÅ¿ter that grow in a half-Round. By means of theÅ¿e Rounds, every Wall will one time of the day or other, have a Å¿hare of the Sun, and the beÅ¿t Walls (by reaÅ¿on of Å¿uch a Reflection, and Collection of the Sun-beams as will be in every Round) will be exceeding hot, and the Trees be more Å¿ecure from Winds.</p>
                     <p>A Pale is as good for this purpoÅ¿e, and in reÅ¿pect of Ripening Fruit better than any thing elÅ¿e; it can be raiÅ¿ed up too, if the Pale be made of Å¿awed Boards, nine or ten Foot high, and exactly joined, that no wind may come through; next to this in goodneÅ¿s is a Brick-Wall, and then a Stone-Wall; and the worÅ¿t of all that which is made of Tymber and Morter; but in this

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:154132:66"/>Branches, that had them not before, and to mend and improve thoÅ¿e that before had them, and the way of it is as followeth.</p>
                     <p>About the beginning of <hi>February</hi> next before you deÅ¿ign to cut theÅ¿e Stems, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly above the place you intend to cut them off at, for above a Foot in length, faÅ¿ten about them Å¿ome Earth in an Old Hat, or Boot, or Bag made of Å¿ome Å¿trong Cloth: and in that Earth they will have put forth Roots againÅ¿t the <hi>Octob.</hi> following, when you are to cut them off to Å¿et them.</p>
                     <p>Or (which is a quicker and readier way) you may dawb Å¿ome wet Earth or Clay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the place, and wrap a Hay-band a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, putting Å¿ome moiÅ¿t Earth likewiÅ¿e betwixt the rounds of the Band, and then running it about again over the Å¿paces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt thoÅ¿e firÅ¿t rounds of the Hay-band, and making faÅ¿t the ends of it.</p>
                     <p>If the Stem have no Bur, before you go either of theÅ¿e ways to work, then take off here and there a little Å¿lice of Bark, about an Inch long round about it, near the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the place to be cover'd, as hath been directed.</p>
                     <p>Some direct that before this applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Earth, about an Inch breadth of the Bark be taken off round about the part of the Branch, that is to be Å¿urrounded with the Earth, that Roots may Å¿hoot out in greater quantity, by coming out in the upper skirts of that Circle, as well as in the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:154132:66"/>lower; but this is but a Crotchet, and grounded (as my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> and others have obÅ¿erved) upon the opinion of deÅ¿cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion of the Sap; whereas indeed there is no Å¿uch thing; for the whole maÅ¿s of Sap is always aÅ¿cending, but in leÅ¿Å¿er quantity in the Winter; becauÅ¿e the Tree is then only to be nouriÅ¿hed, and kept alive, to which end a Å¿mall Å¿upply is Å¿ufficient, and yet neceÅ¿Å¿ary; and in greater plenty in the Summer to furniÅ¿h the Tree with Leaves, Fruit, and new yearly growth; and the true reaÅ¿on why Leaves and Fruit fall off towards Winter, is not becauÅ¿e the Sap re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns downward from them, but becauÅ¿e the Sap aÅ¿cends not Å¿o vigorouÅ¿ly at Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as in the Summer, by reaÅ¿on of the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s of the SeaÅ¿on, and the Suns Å¿mall Å¿tay on our Horizon, and becauÅ¿e they have arrived to their full ripeneÅ¿s, and the Trees fail by degrees to convey up Å¿o much Sap as it did in the Summer to them, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce freÅ¿h ones; and therefore conÅ¿equent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that's an idle miÅ¿take too, to think that the Sap or Juice in the Winter, is laid up in the Roots, as a RepoÅ¿itory, as appears plainly, inaÅ¿much as they are ever found dryer in the Winter than in the Summer, Å¿o that upon the whole, this taking the Bark off round the Branch is good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but to endanger it by intercepting the Juice or Sap, which riÅ¿es in greateÅ¿t quantity betwixt the Bark and the Wood;
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:154132:67"/>but if as before was hinted, you take Å¿ome little Å¿lices of the Bark off round the Branch, here and there, leaving the Bark entire in Å¿ome places, this may by checking the Sap, cauÅ¿e it the more abundantly paÅ¿s and be converted into Roots.</p>
                     <p>But to proceed to the buÅ¿ineÅ¿s in hand, you have Å¿een the way of preparing Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings by CircumpoÅ¿ition; and though Å¿ome will pretend to raiÅ¿e Trees of any kind by the uÅ¿e of it, yet it's certain it avails not, but only in Å¿uch as by a peculiar property are apt to put forth Roots, being cut off and Å¿et into the Ground, and thoÅ¿e gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally known and made uÅ¿e of this way, are the KentiÅ¿h Codling, the Gennet-Moil, Å¿ome Å¿orts of Å¿weet Apples, and Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿weets, the Quince-tree, the Mulberry-tree, Goodsberry-trees, Curran-trees, and the ParadiÅ¿e Apple-tree, which laÅ¿t is much commended by Mr. <hi>Rea,</hi> for to raiÅ¿e Stcocks for Dwarf Apple-trees.</p>

                        <note place="margin">To raiÅ¿e Stocks by cutting down an old Tree.</note>Â§. 6. Another way to raiÅ¿e Stocks for Dwarf-trees is, to cut down Å¿ome one Tree of little worth, of Å¿uch a kind as you want Stocks of, about a Foot or more from the ground: This will make Å¿ome kind of Trees very apt to caÅ¿t forth very good Suckers from the old Roots; Å¿uch as are of two years growth may be tranÅ¿planted; and the Å¿tump above ground, will alÅ¿o put forth abundance of young Shoots: after
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:154132:67"/>theÅ¿e young Shoots have grown out of the Stump one year, caÅ¿t Mold or Earth about them a good height, Å¿o that you cover not the Tops of any of them, where let them grow two years more, and they will be well rooted, then cut them off from the old Stock (which after that may yield freÅ¿h ones again) and Å¿et the Shoots you take off as before hath been directed about Cuttings.</p>
                     <p>TheÅ¿e will be about three years longer before they be ready to Graft than Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, but will be very good young freÅ¿h Stocks, and is a good way to raiÅ¿e Stocks of the Quince-tree for Pears, becauÅ¿e Quince-trees generally grow Å¿o crooked and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, that its difficult to procure any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iderable quantity of them by Cuttings.</p>
                     <p>If they Å¿hoot up tall after they are mold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, you had beÅ¿t top them at a convenient height; it will make them grow the more in bigneÅ¿s and Å¿o be Å¿ooner fit to Graft. But if you have a deÅ¿ire to have any of the Å¿ame kind as the old Tree was, you need not top them.</p>
                     <p>And by this means if you want Quince-trees, Codlings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you may be furniÅ¿hed with plenty, that will make better and handÅ¿omer Trees than if you raiÅ¿e them by Cuttings.</p>

                     <p>If your Pear-trees yield not Suckers of themÅ¿elves, you need only cut off the top of Å¿ome old ill Pear-tree (and Graff it with a better Fruit if you pleaÅ¿e) and the Roots will caÅ¿t forth Suckers plentifully, and you may help them by making a Å¿mall Ditch or Gutter Å¿o as to bear Å¿ome of the Roots a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two yards diÅ¿tant from the Tree, or pare off the GraÅ¿s (if any grow about the Tree) that they may have the more liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Å¿pring up.</p>
                     <p>Or in this caÅ¿e you may bare the Roots, and then give a Cut croÅ¿s Å¿ome Roots al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moÅ¿t to the Heart, and from the croÅ¿s Cut cleave the Root, raiÅ¿ing up the looÅ¿e part, and put in a little Stone to keep it open; cover it three Inches over with Mold; let this be done if you can, where you find a Bud or Eye on the Root for the Sucker to Shoot out at, and either inoculate the young Shoot in the place where it Å¿tands, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it to Å¿ome other place after a years growth, and when you do, cut off with it about a Foot of the old Root; and by this means you may have Suckers from Å¿ome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Trees, that do not naturally yield them.</p>

                     <p>Â§. 1. MUltitudes of Fruit-trees may be Planted abroad in the Fields and Hedges of incloÅ¿ed Grounds, whereof very great profit may be made without any conÅ¿iderable damage either to Corn, Hay, or PaÅ¿ture, and its beÅ¿t in this way to Plant the courÅ¿er, harder, and long-keeping kinds of Fruits, which will not be meanly Å¿erviceable to a Family by uÅ¿ing them ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Baking or Cyder. TheÅ¿e Trees being about Å¿even Foot high before they begin to Å¿pread, will be out of the reach of Cattle, and not troubleÅ¿ome to Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men about Hay and Corn in Summer-time, if Planted twenty or thirty Yards diÅ¿tant one from another, and in Ranks through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Field, that the Plow may continue a Å¿traight Furrow all along from one end to the other, whereby Corn will grow near the Roots of Å¿uch Trees almoÅ¿t as good as any where in the Field, and GraÅ¿s as much or more under Trees as where none are,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:154132:70"/>tho not altogether Å¿o Å¿weet, by reaÅ¿on of the droppings, yet the multitude of Fruit abundantly compenÅ¿ates the damage almoÅ¿t Ten-fold.</p>
                     <p>Many Countries in <hi>England</hi> have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced the benefit of Planting in the Fields, where it hath been of long and general uÅ¿age, and in many other Countries Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen have begun already to imitate them, which Å¿hould much encourage others to follow; for the more there are that Plant, the leÅ¿s particular perÅ¿ons will loÅ¿e by Thieves, and where Fruit is in great plean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it is found to be more Å¿lighted by Idle people; and beÅ¿ides if a man hath Å¿tore, hee'l not feel the loÅ¿s of a little, or it may quit his coÅ¿t, to have one to caÅ¿t an Eye to them, for a months time near ripening; and further yet Cyder-Apples, Baking-Pears, and Pears for Perry are Å¿o little grateful to the TaÅ¿t (which Pilferers chiefly aim at pleaÅ¿ing) that he that taÅ¿ts them once, Å¿hall Å¿carcely find his Teeth water after them a Å¿econd time. However the benefit of Planting in Fields much out-weighs theÅ¿e and all other incoveniences; for by this means you may have a double Crop on your Lands, <hi>viz.</hi> GraÅ¿s or Corn, and your Fruit, and the Land rather bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿itted (as the matter may be ordered) than damaged; One of theÅ¿e Trees alÅ¿o bears as much Fruit as three of the beÅ¿t in a thick-planted Orchard, the benefit
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:154132:71"/>whereof for Sale or uÅ¿e in a Family for Bak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or Liquors, or other uÅ¿es, is known to be Å¿o very conÅ¿iderable, that it's needleÅ¿s to Å¿ay more of it.</p>

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:154132:71"/>that every man may uÅ¿e that which Å¿uits beÅ¿t with his conveniency and good likeing.</p>
                     <p>Â§. 3. If your Land be in tillage, you may Å¿et Fruit-trees at thirty Yards diÅ¿tance from one another,<note place="margin">How to Plantwhole Fields.</note> throughout the whole Fields, in Å¿traight and direct Rows, after the manner of an Orchard, and you may go on with your Plowing with the loÅ¿s on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of about a yard, or four Foot Square of Land about every Tree for twenty years at leaÅ¿t, and when they are grown Å¿o big, that you think your Corn receives hurt by the Å¿hade or droppings of the Trees, if you can turn it to paÅ¿ture, the Trees will improve moÅ¿t kind of Land, by keeping it warm in the Spring, they will make the GraÅ¿s come and grow more early, and by Shades in the Summer preÅ¿erve it from burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but the Trees being Å¿et at Å¿uch a diÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, the Land may continue for any purpoÅ¿e for ever, if you dreÅ¿s or Prune theÅ¿e Trees higher up than any other, that no Boughs may hang in the reach of Cattle, and for convenience of going about them with your Team to any work, and thereby the Air and Rain will have free acceÅ¿s to the GraÅ¿s, or Grain near about them, and the Fruit will be Å¿afer from common Pilferers. TheÅ¿e need no other fencing than Thorns bound about them, and a Stake driven in the midÅ¿t to keep them from Å¿haking; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e you may receive the proÅ¿it of the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:154132:72"/>Stubble or Fallow without Å¿uffering any large Cattle to come into the Ground, that will browÅ¿e upon them.</p>
                     <p>Â§. 4. Another way of Planting Fruit-trees in Fields is by Å¿etting Walks of them,<note place="margin">How to Plant Walks of Fruit-trees in Fields.</note> running through the midÅ¿t, or along the Å¿ides of your PaÅ¿ture-grounds, where you have a mind to have Walks for ornament, or Å¿hady: for why Walks of Fruit-trees Å¿hould not be rather Planted than of Elm, Sycamores, AÅ¿h-trees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> none can pretend a reaÅ¿on, there being Å¿ome Å¿orts of Fruit-trees that will (and almoÅ¿t any kind may be ordered Å¿o as to) grow very handÅ¿ome in Å¿hape, beÅ¿ides the beauty and Å¿weet Å¿mell of the BloÅ¿Å¿oms, and worth of the Fruit.</p>
                     <p>To prevent damage by Cattle, if you go this way to work in Field Planting, they muÅ¿t be well grown before you Å¿et them, that is, they muÅ¿t be of about Å¿ix years growth, and then well fenced, and there are two ways uÅ¿ed to Å¿ave them harmleÅ¿s. 1. One much commended is by Tumping them,<note place="margin">To Å¿et Trees by Tumping.</note> and it's performed thus, <hi>viz.</hi> Å¿et your Trees in the place deÅ¿igned on the top, or almoÅ¿t on the top of the Ground, no deeper than to make it Å¿tand, tho all the Roots be not cover'd, till the Tump or Mound be raiÅ¿ed about it; and then take a line about a yard and quarter long, tye the one end of it about the Tree, but Å¿o
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:154132:72"/>that in going round the Tree with the Line Å¿train'd, it may Å¿lip about the Tree as you go; faÅ¿ten the other end to an Iron Å¿etter or Å¿tick with a Å¿harp point, and as you go round the Tree, mark the Ground; Make then a Ditch on the out-Å¿ide of the round Score, and lay the Turf handÅ¿omly two or three heights, with the GraÅ¿s-Å¿ide outward Å¿o as to make the work full half a yard, or two Foot high; then caÅ¿t the Mold out of the Ditch, obÅ¿erving to throw the beÅ¿t of it next the Roots of the Tree, till you have raiÅ¿ed it within as high as the Turf; then prick Å¿trong Thorns into the Mold, that they may lye upon the Turf, and point outwards a yard over the Turf; as you place the Thorns, put more Turf or faÅ¿t heavy Earth out of the Ditch upon the ends of them, treading it down the better to fix them, and lay the Earth Å¿helving down from the Turf towards the Tree, that if Rain fall it may Å¿oke towards the Roots; if you have any Å¿mall Thorns, Bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars, Furs, or GorÅ¿e, lay it one the top of the work finiÅ¿hed, round the Tree and repair all yearly as you Å¿ee cauÅ¿e, which may be done with Å¿mall trouble. The following obÅ¿ervations will demonÅ¿trate the great convenience of Å¿etting Fruit-trees this way.</p>
                     <p>FirÅ¿t if your Land be over moiÅ¿t this Ditch will drain all wet from the Roots of the Tree; but if the Land be Clay or
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:154132:73"/>Å¿uch that the Water will Å¿tand in, then when you perceive it (which is very rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) cut Å¿ome little Notch or Trench to let it out.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, This way of Å¿etting is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in dry Land; becauÅ¿e the Earth of the Mound will Å¿ecure the Roots from the heat of the Sun, and every Å¿hower of Rain will much refreÅ¿h it, by Å¿oaking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Tree.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, You need not bind your Tree to a Å¿take which doth often gall and Hurt the Tree, for Å¿o much Earth about it will keep it Å¿teady,</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, If your Land be Å¿tiff, or Å¿trong old Land, the Mound made of it will mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and improve about the Roots, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿o by that time the Roots Å¿pread as far as the Ditch, it will be fill'd up with Mold fallen from the Tump, and with Å¿ticks, Leaves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which will be rotten, looÅ¿e, and good for Trees to Root in, and by that time they will need little or no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, if any at all; A few Thorns tyed about the bodies of the Trees, to keep Cattle from rubbing againÅ¿t them will be enough.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, The Chief benefit of Å¿etting Trees thus, is, that where the Soil is Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what too moiÅ¿t or Å¿hallow, the Tree being Å¿et on the top of the Land, will put forth it's Roots plentifully into the Earth caÅ¿t
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:154132:73"/>up, and thence Å¿hoot into the upper Turf and beÅ¿t Land that hath been Plowed and manured before.</p>
                     <p>Another way of Fencing is, by erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a Foot and a half diÅ¿tance one from another, about every Tree three Å¿mall PoÅ¿ts, (if they be Å¿awed they need be but three Inches Å¿quare) or you may uÅ¿e Poles, or Å¿traight Boughs, either whole, or if big enough, cloven in two, three or four parts, about five Foot above the Ground in height, being driven into the Ground, nail a croÅ¿s Bar of Wood from each to other, within a Hand's breadth of the tops of the PoÅ¿ts, to which Bar, nail a Pale or two betwixt each two PoÅ¿ts, Å¿tuck into the Ground or nail'd to the like CroÅ¿s Bat within a Foot of the bottom of the PoÅ¿ts; the way of it may be Å¿een now in diverÅ¿e places, and learn't in a Minute; though what's Å¿aid here makes it plain enough.</p>
                     <p>This way is more chargable than Tump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, where Timber is Å¿carce, but much more dureable than it, and abÅ¿olutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ary where Deer, or Rabbets, or any thing that peels the Bark off, come into the Land Planted.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Planting near Hedg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in the Fields.</note>Â§. 5. Another way of Planting in Fields which hath been Å¿ucceÅ¿sfully PractiÅ¿ed, is thus; When you Å¿cour a Ditch, and cut down or plaiÅ¿h an old QuickÅ¿et-Hedg, then Å¿et a row of Trees within a yard of the Hedg
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:154132:74"/>on that Å¿ide that is not Ditch't, and Fence them with half-Round Tumps only on the one Å¿ide, for the Hedg will Å¿ecure them on the other, and from the cut or plaiÅ¿h't Hedg, you will commonly have Thorns and Bryars enough for the Mounds, to Fence it as hath been before directed; and at the Å¿ame time, or in Summer, draw Å¿ome of the Quickthorns, Hips, or Bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars, from the Hedg in o the Fence, about the Tump which will contribute to the Å¿trengthening and preÅ¿erving the dead fence you had made about it before; Å¿o that you may be free from trouble about it for ever after.</p>
                     <p>There are theÅ¿e advantages in this way of Planting, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. The Ditch on the out-Å¿ide the Hedg drains the Ground and makes it healthful and Å¿ound.</item>
                        <item>2. The Ground near the Hedg is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly very Rich, as not having been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriÅ¿hed by Tillage, but improved Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by the often Å¿couring of the Ditch, and commonly with the Dung of Cattle, that for Å¿helter, Shade or Fodder repair thither.</item>
                        <item>3. Its not the leaÅ¿t hindrance to Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or GraÅ¿s; for the Hedg when its grown up, uÅ¿ually beareth out as far as the Tree is Å¿et in the Field.</item>
                        <item>4. And this is much better than Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Hedg Row, as many do; for in
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:154132:74"/>a large top its apter to weaken the Hedg under it, but theÅ¿e being Å¿et a little diÅ¿tance from the Hedg, and growing (as they will) with the greateÅ¿t part of their Heads from it, will not damage it.</item>
                        <item>5. The Fruit may be gathered with much more eaÅ¿e, than of thoÅ¿e that are Planted in the Hedges.</item>
                        <item>6. They will not be choak't or hurt by the Hedg when its grown up, but be good handÅ¿ome fair Trees.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>You may Å¿et theÅ¿e at eight yards diÅ¿tance, or nearer, being but one Å¿ingle Row, and Å¿o if but half a Field (as uÅ¿ually it falls out) have the Ditch on the out-Å¿ide, you may Å¿et a conÅ¿iderable number, and find advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage without damage, and with inconÅ¿ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable charge, eÅ¿pecially if the Ditch Å¿tand on the North-Å¿ide, if you can, therefore chooÅ¿e Å¿uch Hedges.</p>
                     <p>This is not to be practiÅ¿ed near Hedges that are full of great Wood, or Trees; but if there be but few Trees, its but leaving a vacancy near Å¿uch Trees, and Å¿et<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting your Fruit-trees againÅ¿t Å¿uch places, where there grow none in the Hedg.</p>

                        <note place="margin">How to Plant in Hedges is the Fields.</note>Â§. 6. Another way of Planting in Fields is this, if you would Plant without any charge of Fencing, you may do it in your Hedges; theÅ¿e Trees muÅ¿t be well grown and Å¿trong, that the Hedg choak them not while they are young: and when you
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:154132:75"/>plaiÅ¿h or cut down a Quick Hedg, obÅ¿erve no certain diÅ¿tance, but as it happens where you find it moÅ¿t free from Quick, Å¿et a Tree and incloÅ¿e the Body in the Hedg, but bind not the Etherings too cloÅ¿e about it, leÅ¿t they gall and fret it, and as it groweth obÅ¿erve what Thorns annoy it, and cut them off.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Planting by the Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of Gennet-Moils, &amp;c.</note>Â§. 7. If you have a mind to Å¿et any Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of Codlings, Gennet-Moils, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Apple-trees that grow of Cuttings, they will proÅ¿per very well in, or rather near a Hedg, becauÅ¿e generally there the Mold is looÅ¿e and mellow for them to put forth Roots in, and Å¿omewhat enrich't by the frequent cleanÅ¿ing of the Ditch; if you Plant them near the Hedg, you muÅ¿t a little Fence them on the one Å¿ide, as by the third foregoing direction; but the Tumps you raiÅ¿e to Å¿et the Thorns in, muÅ¿t not be above a Foot high, for the Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings will Å¿hoot out their Roots, almoÅ¿t to the top of the Earth about them, and a high Mound falling down by degrees, Å¿ome of the beÅ¿t Roots may be left bare, or very little Earth upon them.</p>
                     <p>The way of preparing Plants for this purpoÅ¿e, is by CircumpoÅ¿ition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as is directed in the 11 <hi>Chap.</hi> of Dwarf-trees.</p>
                     <p>Make choice of Cuttings or Stems as big as a Mans wriÅ¿t (if you can) towards the lower end; before you Å¿et them, prune
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:154132:75"/>them out of the reach of Cattle, and leave but little top on them when you Å¿et them, neither let them be very long; if the tops be out of the reach of the Cattle its e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Planting in Fields by long Crab-tree Stocks.</note>Â§. 8. There be Å¿ome that get long Crab-tree-Å¿tocks out of Woods, or elÅ¿e dreÅ¿s Å¿ome up in their NurÅ¿eries to grow tall, and Å¿et them in their Fields or Hedges, and at three years Å¿tanding Graft them, which may do well and is better approved of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e there needs no removal after they are Grafted (which is of great advantage as to make both good-bearing and Å¿ound Trees) but Å¿ome inconvenience there is in this way: the long Stocks out of Woods being commonly very old, their Bark thick, their Roots big, they thrive but indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently; and thoÅ¿e raiÅ¿ed in NurÅ¿eries will Å¿eldom be taper grown, or Å¿trong enough to bear a large top well, after they are Grafted Å¿o high as they ought, being Å¿et in Fields: You will alÅ¿o be longer in raiÅ¿ing Stocks to that height, and any conÅ¿iderable Å¿trength (as is neceÅ¿Å¿ary for this purpoÅ¿e) than in raiÅ¿ing Trees, if your Stocks be Grafted young in your NurÅ¿ery, becauÅ¿e they thrive more after Grafting than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and in both CaÅ¿es if you Graft them high, the Stocks will be continually put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out Å¿prouts of their own kind below the place they are Grafted at, which will
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:154132:76"/>require frequent cutting off; if you Graft them not very high you will find it difficult to defend them from the nipping of Cattle, and from the Cyens being broke out of the Stocks by Å¿ome caÅ¿ualties or other, to which they are more expoÅ¿ed in Fields that lye common to Cattle, than NurÅ¿eries that are incloÅ¿ed.</p>

Many cut off the tops of old Crab-trees, or Apple-trees, and Graft the body or Trunk, but the Cyens could never cover the Heads of thoÅ¿e Stocks, and by that time the top was a little grown up, the body was ready to periÅ¿h with rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s. The beÅ¿t way for big Crabtrees (or if you would change the kind of any Fruit-trees) is to Graft them in the Boughs, where they are not bigger than a Mans Arm, making uÅ¿e of none but thoÅ¿e that grow handÅ¿ome at convenient diÅ¿tance one from
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:154132:76"/>another, cutting off the others Å¿mooth and even, cloÅ¿e to the Body of the Tree.</p>
                     <p>To do this, that Winter that you cut or plaiÅ¿h a Hedg, order the Workmen to trim up, but not to lop or top the Crab-trees, unleÅ¿s it be the tops of the Boughs two Foot above the place you intend to Graft them at, and then in <hi>March</hi> following Å¿aw off the Heads at proper places and Graft them.</p>

Many are for Grafting theÅ¿e in the Cleft; becauÅ¿e they think the Cyen hath beÅ¿t hold, and will not be Å¿o Å¿ubject to be broke off, or out, by the Wind, as thoÅ¿e Grafted in the Bark; but many times thoÅ¿e in the Cleft are broke out by the Wind, neither can you perceive that the Wood of the Cyen in the Cleft did ever cement with the Wood of the Stock, but only on the outÅ¿ide as the others do: And thoÅ¿e in the Cleft are not Å¿o apt to grow all of them, nor to make Å¿o great a growth as thoÅ¿e in the Bark, which with a little wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineÅ¿s may be preÅ¿erved from danger of the Wind, and full as much care muÅ¿t be had about thoÅ¿e Grafted in the Cleft, if you will preÅ¿erve them all from the Å¿ame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice.</p>

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:154132:77"/>Grafting, and look upon it as a thing well worthy to be taken notice of and obÅ¿erved.</p>
                     <p>When you have prepared the Cyen as you are directed to do when you Graft in the Bark, apply it to the place you deÅ¿ign to put it in, and Å¿lit the Bark of the Bough through on both Å¿ides the Cyen cloÅ¿e to it, beginning at the top of the Bough, and not carrying the Å¿lits much above half length of the Å¿lope of the Cyen, Å¿eparate that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle portion of the Bark between the two Å¿lits, from the Wood with your InÅ¿trument, thruÅ¿ting it a little lower than the Å¿lits, to let in the Cyen as far as it is Å¿loped, and then Å¿tick the Cyen in, having firÅ¿t taken off from the edges of the Cyen any uneven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s (not cutting through the Bark) that all may the better fit together, and you may put in two, three, or four Cyens in every head, having reÅ¿pect to the bigneÅ¿s of it; or you may in the biggeÅ¿t put in two Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens in the Cleft, and two others in the Bark, doing one of the later on the WeÅ¿t-Å¿ide of it, for then the Wind blowing it towards the Head, is not Å¿o apt to break it out, as if it drove it from the head; bind the heads and Clay them as you heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and continue to do Å¿o yearly till the heads are almoÅ¿t covered.</p>
                     <p>At firÅ¿t Claying, Å¿tick in Feathers or long EÅ¿cures, to prevent Birds lighting on the Cyens.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>July</hi> following (whether you Graft
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:154132:77"/>theÅ¿e big Stocks in the Cleft or Bark) pick off moÅ¿t of the Leaves of the Cyens, and cut off Å¿uch Å¿prigs as growing inward will make the head thick, and all Å¿tragling out Boughs, that the Wind may not have Å¿o much force upon them to break the Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches out of the Stocks.</p>
                     <p>Cut off alÅ¿o Å¿ome of the biggeÅ¿t Shoots the Crab-tree puts forth of its own kind; but for the firÅ¿t three years, you muÅ¿t not cut off all, left the Tree not having liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to vent all the Sap that cometh up, Å¿ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit and dye, the Å¿mall Grafts not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to receive near Å¿o much Sap as the old top did the year before.</p>
                     <p>Thus many Country-men when they take off the head of an old Oak, have Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times found it dye, and therefore in Å¿ome Countries, they leave one big Bough to grow for one year to draw up the Sap, (as they term it) whereas it is indeed that the Sap may have liberty to vent it Å¿elf; for Trees that have a thick Bark, as old Oaks have, when all the Å¿mall Boughs are cut off, are long in putting forth Branches; and difficulty at laÅ¿t put forth Å¿o many as will Å¿pend the Sap which comes up the Tree, in Å¿ome proportion to what it did the year before, when the whole top was on, which Sap being chiefly in the greateÅ¿t Channel betwixt or near the Bark and out-Å¿ide of the Body of the Tree, and not being ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is either dryed or conÅ¿umed by the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:154132:78"/>heat of the Sun, or putrifies for want of that continual motion that is in it, when it hath vent, that Å¿everal Trees dye of this DiÅ¿eaÅ¿e; and when Trees dye this way the Bark will drop off from the Body of them Å¿ooner by Å¿ome years than otherwiÅ¿e.</p>
                     <p>Hence it is that you may kill a Tree, by lopping off the whole top in the Summer time, or Å¿o much of it that the remaining Boughs cannot receive all the Sap, but it ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth choakt up for want of IÅ¿Å¿ue.</p>
                     <p>The Å¿econd Summer you ought to bind Å¿ome Hay-ropes, about the lower part of the Cyens; there will be no great need of repeating this the third Summer, but if done, it will the more certainly Å¿ecure them from breaking by the Wind.</p>
                     <p>Thus you may Å¿ecurely and Å¿peedily Graft old Trees, that are either bad Bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or bear Fruit of bad kinds, and they will in three or four years hear plentifully, if you take care (which you always ought to do upon any Grafting or inoculating) to Graft them with kinds that experience of your Å¿elf, or others, can faithfully aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ure you to be of very good bearing kinds.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Of Pruning Vines.</note>Â§. 5. As Vines Å¿tand in more need of Pruning than other Fruit-trees, Å¿o great care is to be taken in the performing of it; when you have Å¿et your Vine as you have been before directed, Å¿o that not above two Buds of it remain above Ground, you are to nail up Å¿uch Branches as grow forth up to the Wall, till it have over-Å¿pread as much Wall as you deÅ¿ign for it, Å¿uffering not above two Branches to grow from the Ground, and Å¿nipping yearly the tops of the Branches a conÅ¿iderable length, as far as they are weak and tender, and alÅ¿o all Å¿mall poor ones, cloÅ¿e to the body, unleÅ¿s the well-liking Branches be but few, and then you may leave the loweÅ¿t Bud of Å¿ome of them, to grow forth next year, and this you are to do yearly towards <hi>February,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>January.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When your Vine comes to bear, you are to uÅ¿e your Knife about it three times in the year.</p>
                     <p>FirÅ¿t at fartheÅ¿t in <hi>February,</hi> and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining thereof you are to prune off part of the foregoing years Shoots where they are too thick, cloÅ¿e to the old Wood. As it enriches your Vine to keep it thin of Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Å¿o you muÅ¿t take care it be well Å¿tored with Buds againÅ¿t the Spring fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, for it bears Grapes only on the new Shoots of every year; and in cutting off theÅ¿e Branches, you muÅ¿t take care your Wall continue furniÅ¿hed with Å¿uch Branches
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:154132:81"/>as may be Å¿pread upon the Wall regularly and decently, not thick in one place and thin in another, nor croÅ¿Å¿ing out another. On every Sprig you cut off in this Pruning, where you would have Fruit the Å¿ucceeding year, leave two or three Buds, for out of thoÅ¿e Buds, eÅ¿pecially the Å¿econd or third, proceeds the CluÅ¿ters; alÅ¿o cut off the Branch aÅ¿lope on one Å¿ide or under, that the Rain reÅ¿t not on the Pith of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining part.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The next time to take off Å¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluties from your Vine is about MidÅ¿um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, when the Grapes are knit; clip off then the end of the Branches that have Grapes on them, a little above the Grapes, that they may have the more nouriÅ¿hment and keep them nail'd to the Wall, as alÅ¿o barren Branches where the Wall needs them.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The laÅ¿t time of cutting is in <hi>AuguÅ¿t,</hi> for then, becauÅ¿e Leaves and Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches may be Å¿o thick, as to keep the Heat of the Sun from the Grapes, which is neceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ary to ripen them, you may pluck off Å¿ome of the Leaves, and cut off Å¿ome of the Branches to open way for the Sun to come to them.</p>
                     <p>There's on thing to be obÅ¿erved in Prun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theÅ¿e, peculiar to it, that whereas others are cut at a Bud, the Branches of theÅ¿e muÅ¿t be cut off near the midÅ¿t betwixt two Buds, and that not later in the year than the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:154132:81"/>of <hi>February,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Note. that <hi>December</hi> and <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,</hi> are the beÅ¿t times for tee Winter Pruning of Vines.</note> for afterwards the Sap or Juice will run out, and the Vine will be much weakened by bleeding. You will by that time alÅ¿o Å¿ee what the FroÅ¿t of the Winter foregoing hath kill'd, which muÅ¿t be taken all away.</p>
                     <p>If FroÅ¿ts come before any Grapes are ripe, defend them in the night time by Tilts or Mats.</p>
                     <p>Â§. 6. It's not worth your labour to Plant Vines by EÅ¿paliers,<note place="margin">Vineyards proÅ¿per not in <hi>England.</hi>
                        </note> or in a Vineyard in <hi>England;</hi> becauÅ¿e of the early nipping FroÅ¿ts which our Clymate is very Å¿ubject to, which is the reaÅ¿on ti's Å¿eldom uÅ¿ed, and the uÅ¿age of people in Å¿uch caÅ¿es affords no weak Argument that it's of no advantage; And Grapes Å¿eldom or never ripen well in this IÅ¿le, without great help of Art and induÅ¿try, to which purpoÅ¿e take theÅ¿e di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.</p>
                     <p>FirÅ¿t, To Plant Å¿uch as ripen Å¿ooneÅ¿t in the year, that they may have as much of the Summer heat at ripening time as may be.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Let the Wall you Plant them againÅ¿t, be a full South, or but a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to the EaÅ¿t; or if you have a half round, or corner in a Wall, or the back of a Brick Chimney, or a Kiln-wall, or Barn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall poÅ¿ited as aforeÅ¿aid, make uÅ¿e of Å¿uch places for them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="146" facs="tcp:154132:82"/>Vines will proÅ¿per and bear well againÅ¿t a high Wall, yet that is not altogether Å¿o neceÅ¿Å¿ary but that low Walls may Å¿erve turn, and the higher may be reÅ¿erved for Å¿uch Fruit-trees as will not do well with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them. That of a Tarras Walk may do well for Vines, and the Gravel Walk under the Wall mightily encreaÅ¿e the heat about them.</p>
                     <p>If you Plant any Trees againÅ¿t your dwelling-houÅ¿e Wall, there may be Å¿ome narrow places between two windows, or the like, where other Fruit-trees have not room to Å¿pread: a Vine may grow up there, and above thoÅ¿e narrow places enlarge it Å¿elf where ever it meets with room.</p>
                     <p>You may alÅ¿o Plant a Vine betwixt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Fruit-tree that groweth againÅ¿t your hotteÅ¿t Walls, and let it Å¿pread a little in the Summer time into the Fruit-trees on either Å¿ide, eÅ¿pecially if the Fruit of Å¿uch Trees uÅ¿e to be early ripe, or that they bear little Fruit, or have not been Å¿o long Å¿et as to have covered the Wall. And tho Å¿uch Vines cannot extend themÅ¿elves to that bigneÅ¿s, as thoÅ¿e Planted where they have more room; yet by this means you will make advantage of Å¿uch portions of your Wall, as otherwiÅ¿e you could have but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle benefit from.</p>
                     <p>Some Vines Shoot Å¿orth exceeding large Branches yearly, but bear little; in Å¿uch caÅ¿es bare the Roots, and cut off a MaÅ¿ter
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:154132:82"/>Root, or two from the Tree, then lay Å¿ome Sand, AÅ¿hes; or any hot barren Soil to the Roots, and it will abate the redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy of Sap, and conduce to bearing Fruits.</p>
                     <p>Â§. 7. Do not pull or cut off your Vine-Leaves in <hi>AuguÅ¿t,</hi> or <hi>September,</hi> with deÅ¿ign of giving acceÅ¿s to the Suns heat, thereby to acclerate the maturity of the Fruit, as many frequently uÅ¿e to do, and as is before directed in <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. for on my own experince, Å¿uch depriving the Grape of it's Leafed Å¿helter from the cool Air, or morning FroÅ¿ts, hath always proved pernicious and deÅ¿truct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the Grape; and I have often obÅ¿erv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the beÅ¿t Grapes and earlieÅ¿t ripe, to be under the Å¿hadow and Protection of Å¿ome Leaf.</p>

                     <p>THere is not a more delicate Fruit for the Kitchin and ConÅ¿ervatory than the Quince, whereof there are Å¿ome Å¿orts, though not many, Å¿omwhat different from each other.</p>
                     <p>The Portugal Apple Quince, is of beÅ¿t eÅ¿teem, it's a large yellow Fruit, tender, pleaÅ¿ant, and Å¿oon boiled.</p>
                     <p>The Portugal Pear Quince is much like the former, except in it's form.</p>
                     <p>The Barbary Quince is good, but Å¿mall.</p>
                     <p>The Lyons Quince is a large yellow, and the BrunÅ¿wick Quince a large white, both good Fruit, but inferior to the two FirÅ¿t.</p>
                     <p>The EngliÅ¿h Quince is the moÅ¿t Stony, and a harÅ¿h Fruit, and covered with a Doun or Cotton.</p>
                     <p>The way of raiÅ¿ing Quince-trees is by Suckers, Cuttings, as you are taught in the Eleventh <hi>Chap.</hi> aforegoing; and it's only to be added that if you have a part of a
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:154132:87"/>Tree that growth Å¿o low, that you can bring it to the Ground, either by PlaiÅ¿hing or otherwiÅ¿e, you may do it in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Winter, and cover it all with Earth but the ends of the Branches, and let it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue Å¿o one year, and then uncover it, and every Twig will have put forth Roots in the Earth, which being cut off, and tranÅ¿planted will make you a Tree.</p>
                     <p>And this is the way of propagating Fruit-trees by Layers:<note place="margin">How to propagate by Layers.</note> And you may here take notice, that all Å¿uch Trees that may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated by Cuttings, as Currans, Quince, Goosberries, RaÅ¿pherries, Barberries, Figs, Vines, Mulberries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be raiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed likewiÅ¿e by Layers, and this way takes more Å¿ure than by Cuttings. Trees ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally have large Pith that will grow by Cuttings and Layers.</p>
                     <p>Quince-trees delight, and bear beÅ¿t in a fat, moiÅ¿t, rich Land, where Å¿ome Sinck, or Gutter that carries away the Å¿oke or WaÅ¿h of a Dunghil or HouÅ¿e, is a place uÅ¿ually choÅ¿en for them, and is Å¿uch as they like very well in.</p>
                     <p>Some will Graft or Inoculate Quince-Å¿tocks, with Grafts or Buds from Quince-trees of good bearing kinds, which will cauÅ¿e them to bear more early.</p>

The great Yellow Dutch Goosberry, differeth from the laÅ¿t only in colour. The great early Red Goosberry is a fine, Å¿harp, pleaÅ¿ant Fruit, and firÅ¿t ripe; there are likewiÅ¿e Å¿ome that are Blue, differing little from the former, but late ripe, and the Great Green Goosberry late ripe, but good; and there are Å¿everal Å¿mall Goosberries not worth Planting or taking notice of.</p>

                     <p>PEars are of very many kinds, in Å¿o much that Å¿ome have affirm'd that there are no leÅ¿s than four or five hundred Å¿everal kinds; but however, certain it is there are Å¿o many, that to trouble the Reader with their names would be very needleÅ¿s, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Å¿ome of the ChoiceÅ¿t for all uÅ¿es will be moÅ¿t proper for the Å¿toring your Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, eÅ¿pecially if you reÅ¿pect profit more than curioÅ¿ity, which is the main deÅ¿ign of this little Tract.</p>
                     <p>Pears are much improved, as is moÅ¿t Fruit by being Planted againÅ¿t Walls. In <hi>France</hi> they are accounted among their beÅ¿t Fruit, and the beÅ¿t kinds well merit it.</p>
                     <p>The Summer and Winter-Bon-CriÅ¿tien growing pendent are fitter for a Wall, than to be Planted of Standards; the Winter will keep till <hi>May,</hi> and is a very choice Pear.</p>
                     <p>The Bury de-Roy, is eÅ¿teemed for the Table the beÅ¿t of all Summer Pears, it's a fair Brown Pear, excellent in it's Å¿eaÅ¿on,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:154132:97"/>melting in the Mouth, thence call'd the Butter-pear, and bears well againÅ¿t a Wall; the Green Bury-pear, is more Green, and larger than the former.</p>

                     <p>Bontradue, or good HouÅ¿wife is the larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eÅ¿t of Apples, a great bearer, and good for the Kitchin, and makes good Summer Cyder.</p>

                     <p>The Pome-Water is an indifferent good laÅ¿ting Fruit.</p>
                     <p>The Summer Pearmain is known to be an excellent Fruit, but not Å¿o good as the Winter Pearmain.</p>
                     <p>Kirton Pippin or <hi>Holland</hi> Pippin is one of the beÅ¿t Å¿orts of Table-Fruits from Micha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elmas to Alhallontide, and yields very good Cyder.</p>

                     <p>Summer Bellabon is a fair Apple, the Tree a good bearer and the Fruit very good, but will not keep any long time.</p>
                     <p>RuÅ¿Å¿et Pearmain a very pleaÅ¿ant Fruit, continuing long on the Tree, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipates both of the RuÅ¿Å¿et and Pearmain in colour and taÅ¿t.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Concerning MoÅ¿s or Canker.</note>Â§. 1. THe nature of Soil is the chief cauÅ¿e of the MoÅ¿s and Canker, and therefore without altering the one, you can Å¿carce prevent the other, however you may with a hair cloth rub the MoÅ¿s off, after rain, or (as Å¿ome Å¿ay) burn it with a bottle of Straw under the Tree: but if you only Å¿crape or rub off the MoÅ¿s, in few years they'l be as much annoyed therewith as ever; becauÅ¿e MoÅ¿Å¿ineÅ¿s is cauÅ¿ed by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver coldneÅ¿s of the Ground; as in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriÅ¿h and Clay Grounds, and likewiÅ¿e by BarrenneÅ¿s of the Soil. If the coldneÅ¿s pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from over much moiÅ¿ture, lay it dryer, by Trenching the Ground; if Clay Grounds, then mix warmer Soils therewith as you are before taught at <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. <hi>Sect.</hi> 10. yet be Å¿ure you take away the preÅ¿ent MoÅ¿s.</p>
                     <p>All Canker, filth, and Worms, muÅ¿t be picked clean off, and bind Å¿ome Clay well mixt with Hay about the Canker'd place.</p>
                     <p>If the Tree grow but poorly, which is for the moÅ¿t part cauÅ¿ed by the ill temper
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:154132:107"/>of the Soil, open the Ground about the Roots and put in Å¿ome Manure proper to cure it.</p>
                     <p>The Canker aÅ¿Å¿aults generally the beÅ¿t Å¿orts of Fruit-trees, as the Pippin, Pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, Harvy-Apple, Golden Rennet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of Pears the Wardens of all Å¿orts, Burga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mots. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And it Å¿omtimes comes by gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and fretting of Boughs on each other, and Å¿omtimes by Å¿etting Trees not Å¿hallow but too deep, as well as by BarrenneÅ¿s of Soil, and Å¿omtimes it comes by breaking off Boughs (which Å¿hould be cut off cloÅ¿e to the Tree, tho in the Summer) and Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles nipping off the Buds or pieces of the Tree, or unÅ¿eaÅ¿onable Pruning.</p>
                     <p>RaiÅ¿ing of Stocks from Crab kernels in the Å¿ame Land and Grafting on, after once removed, and placed where they are to grow and be Grafted, prevents the Canker.</p>
                     <p>To cure the Canker at preÅ¿ent, cut it out, if it be upon the body or great Boughs of Trees, and waÅ¿h the place with Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dung and urine mixt, and then cover the place with Clay mixed with HorÅ¿e-dung, and cut off the Å¿mall Branches that are dead; however Å¿top the cauÅ¿e by amending the Soil at Roots with proper Manure, as the Dung of Hogs, Pidgeons, Poultry, HorÅ¿es, Cows, the Å¿ediments of Pools, Ponds, Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, Shovelings of yards where Cattle fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to the nature of the Soil.</p>

                        <pb n="197" facs="tcp:154132:107"/>Â§. 2. Slitting the Bark is an excellent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional help to moÅ¿t of the aforÅ¿aid evils,<note place="margin">Bark bound.</note> and alÅ¿o for Bark binding; Å¿ome adviÅ¿e that the Bark be cut according to the grain of it, as in Apple-trees, Pear-trees, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> Å¿traight down; in Cherries <hi>&amp;c.</hi> round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Trees; and where the Graft o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-thrives the Stock, there Å¿lit the Stock, but not quite through the Bark, and this Å¿litting muÅ¿t be done in the Spring about the middle of <hi>February,</hi> or at Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Some Trees proÅ¿per where o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will not.</note>Â§. 3. You'l often find in the Å¿ame Land Å¿ome kinds of Fruit-trees very Å¿ubject to Å¿ome of the beforementioned evils, and others proÅ¿per well; when once you diÅ¿co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver this (becauÅ¿e it's utterly in vain to make Ground and Trees of different Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius agree together) you muÅ¿t make it your buÅ¿ineÅ¿s by degrees to change your Trees, till you have left none againÅ¿t which your Soil beareth Å¿uch an implacable hatred, and furniÅ¿h it with Å¿uch as will flouriÅ¿h and be fruitful.</p>
                     <p>Â§. 4. If any of your Trees are galled by rubbing on each other,<note place="margin">Bark Gall'd</note> or by being bound to Stakes, or by Thorns, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e, lay Å¿ome Clay upon the gald places and wrap Hay-bands about them, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all remove the cauÅ¿e by Pruning, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e.</p>

                        <pb n="198" facs="tcp:154132:108"/>Â§. 5. Bigg Plants that upon there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval have had their Tops cut off,<note place="margin">Dead Tops or bitten Twiggs to be cut off.</note> are apt to dye from the place they were cut off at, to the next Sprig or Branch upon them; theÅ¿e dead parts, or any piece bit by Cattel, ought to be cut off cloÅ¿e to the next good Twig or Shoot, and cover'd with Clay as in Grafting, that the head may be well grown over by Å¿uch Twig or Shoot, and the wet prevented of getting into the Pith, to the dammage of the Tree.</p>
                     <p>Â§. 6. Hares and Rabbets are very miÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous to NurÅ¿eries,<note place="margin">Hares and Coneys.</note> and young Orchards by peeling off the Bark of the Plants; if your Fence be a Wall, or cloÅ¿e Pale, or Water, there's little danger of them, but becauÅ¿e Å¿uch Fences about Orchards are rare, and no other can keep them out, Å¿ome expedient muÅ¿t be made uÅ¿e of.</p>
                     <p>Some have uÅ¿ed Hay Ropes bound about the Tree from the Ground a Å¿ufficient height; but this were endleÅ¿s in a NurÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it may be done in an Orchard, but there are other ways to be preferr'd before it.</p>
                     <p>Others therefore dawb the bodies of the Trees over with Tar, which being uÅ¿ed alone endangers the life of very young Plants, and extreamly hardens the Bark, and otherwiÅ¿e hurts them, which evil is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by mixing the Tar with any kind of GreaÅ¿e, and boiling them on a Fire, Å¿o as both may incorporate, then with a BruÅ¿h,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:154132:108"/>or little Broom, dawb over the body of the Tree, as high as an Hare or Rabbet can reach, and this is to be done about the tenth of <hi>November,</hi> it will preÅ¿erve the Trees for that whole year, with that once doing, it being the Winter time only that they will feed upon the Bark.</p>
                     <p>Some uÅ¿e GreaÅ¿e alone, and then it will require to be laid on twice in a Winter.</p>

                        <note place="margin">PiÅ¿mires and Ants:</note>Â§. 7. If you find PiÅ¿mires, or Ants, breed about or near the Roots of any of your Trees, caÅ¿t away the Earth they lodge in, and Å¿upply it's place with Å¿ome Å¿tiff Clay: If they breed diÅ¿tant in Å¿everal places, Å¿ome direct to dawb the Tree about with Tar, that their feet may be taken in it, but you heard already that's prejudicial to young Trees; but if they peÅ¿ter you extreamly, and your Tree be young, you may bind a Å¿ingle liÅ¿t, or Å¿hred of cloth about it, and once a week (when Buds and BloÅ¿Å¿oms are
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:154132:109"/>putting forth, for that is the chief time they prejudice them) dawb the cloth over with Tar. And where you find their breeding places, pour Å¿calding Water there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

                     <p>Â§. 1. IN gathering of Fruit, be careful that the Branches of your Trees be not battered and broken.</p>
                     <p>Â§. 2. Such as you deÅ¿ign to keep any time, ought not to be Å¿haked off the Trees, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e of bruiÅ¿ing, but picked off with your hands: Be Å¿ure the Fruit you gather be throughly ripe, which you may know by it's beginning to drop, or by cutting an Apple, and Å¿eeing the Kernels turn black: Let the Weather be fair and dry when you gather, and no dew upon the Trees; lay up what you thus gather in a cloÅ¿e, but a Å¿weet room, upon a boarded (but not with Deal) Floor, and not on a Clay, or plaiÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Floor, and lay them up without any green Leaves, or Sticks among them. As you find any in your heaps rot, pick them out, and in FroÅ¿ts cover them with Straw, or Straw Mats, and alÅ¿o hang in Å¿harp FroÅ¿ts Blankets before the Windows to keep out
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:154132:111"/>the FroÅ¿ts. Lay every kind by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves.</p>
                     <p>If you have Å¿ome Pears that are choice and laÅ¿ting, wrap them up in paper, and lay them one by one upon Å¿helves, or hang them up by the Stalks, and keep out the Air from them as much as you can.</p>
                     <p>Â§. 3. In gathering Cyder Fruit, you muÅ¿t be Å¿ure to let them be well ripe on the Tree,<note place="margin">Gathering of Cyder Fruit and preparing it for the Mill.</note> for there is much Cyder Å¿poild be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e the Apples are Ground before they are ripe, and all Fruits yield a different Liquor according to the different degrees of maturity of the Å¿ame Fruit; for when it's moÅ¿t ripe it yields a richer, pleaÅ¿anter and more laÅ¿ting drink; but if preÅ¿Å¿ed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ripe, tho it yields a greater quantity, yet it's but a thin, raw, crude, Å¿owr, phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick, and unwholeÅ¿ome drink: Therefore if your Fruit be not ripe all at one time, Å¿elect Å¿uch Å¿orts as are of a like degree of maturity, or if the Wind beat down ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and you are unwilling to Å¿poil or loÅ¿e them, let them lye dry as long as you can before you grind them, to obtain as great a degree of ripeneÅ¿s as they can, and let that Cyder be thoroughly fermented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore barrel'd, and the firÅ¿t that is Å¿pent; neither mix ripe with unripe Fruit, not ought you to permit Å¿ome Å¿orts of Fruit be too ripe; becauÅ¿e it then grows pulpy in Grinding, and will not yield it's Liquor
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:154132:112"/>unleÅ¿s Å¿ome Water be mixed therewith; your choice Summer Fruits are Å¿ome of them, as alÅ¿o the Pippins, and Renat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings Å¿ubject to pulpineÅ¿s, if full ripe.</p>
                     <p>Lay Å¿uch Fruit by themÅ¿elves (to be Ground and preÅ¿Å¿ed for Cyderkin) that are broken; but a Å¿mall bruiÅ¿e does not much injury.</p>
                     <p>Your Apples being well ripe, let them be gently Å¿haken down, and laid out of the Sun and Rain, not abroad but in a heap; upon a Å¿weet and dry Floor that is board<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (but not with Deals, nor on a plaiÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erd Floor) and on dry, Rye, Wheat or Oaten Straw, till they have Å¿weat out and digeÅ¿ted their crude and phlegmatick hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and there let them Å¿o lye a fortnight; the RedÅ¿treak and harder Apples you may let lye longer, that is, three weaks or a Month; the longer they lye, the leÅ¿s Cyder indeed they will yield, but much the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it being neceÅ¿Å¿ary to have them as ripe as may be, Å¿o that too many of them begin not to rot, which rotten ones are to be picked out.</p>
                     <p>Grind not your Apples immediately from the Tree, Å¿o Å¿oon as they are throughly ripe, tho they will then yield the greater quantity of Liquor, but neither pleaÅ¿ant nor laÅ¿ting, therefore let them lye on heaps as aforeÅ¿aid.</p>
                     <p>By hoarding only of Windfalls for Å¿ome time, or untill the time it was expected they
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:154132:112"/>Å¿hould have been ripe in, doth very much meliorate the Cyder made of them, which otherwiÅ¿e might have been very bad.</p>
                     <p>For from the due time, place, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of hoarding of the Fruit is oftentimes the Cyder very good, which otherwiÅ¿e might have been very bad.</p>
                     <p>Thus when your Fruit is duly ripe, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, preÅ¿erved or hoarded Å¿ome time, it's ready for the Mill.</p>
                     <p>When you bring your Apples to the Mill, or juÅ¿t befor you fill them up; pick out, or caÅ¿t by, all that are Green, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripe, rotten, or otherwiÅ¿e naught, and all Stalks Leaves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that may injure your Cyder, for it's better to want a Å¿mall quantity of Liquor than to Å¿poil the whole.</p>
                     <p>Some are of opinion that rottenneÅ¿s in the Apple injureth not the Cyder, but that a convenient quantity of rotten. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples mixt with the Å¿ound is a great help to the Fermentation and Clarification of the Cyder; but it's Å¿uppoÅ¿ed they mean Å¿uch Apples only as have been bruiÅ¿ed in gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Å¿haking down, or carrying, which will by lying become rotten, and (the skin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whole) be not much the worÅ¿e, only the Cyder will retain a Å¿mack of them; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withÅ¿tanding which, by no means admit them amongÅ¿t your Cyder, that you intend for keeping, but rather make Cyder of them for a more early Å¿pending: for others
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:154132:113"/>affirm, that one rotten Apple corrupts a whole VeÅ¿Å¿el, which I preÅ¿ume is intended only of putrid rottenneÅ¿s.</p>
                     <p>Â§. 4. Grind not your Apples too Å¿mall, for if they are not very Å¿mall Ground,<note place="margin">Of grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and PreÅ¿Å¿ing the Apples.</note> you'l have but little leÅ¿s Cyder (altho the contrary is commonly believed.)</p>
                     <p>After your Fruit is Ground, let it Å¿tand 24 or 48 hours, according as your time and conveniency will admit, Å¿o that it be altogether in good quantities in large VeÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿els; by Å¿tanding thus it not only matures, but acquires colour, commendable in Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and alÅ¿o cauÅ¿es the leÅ¿Å¿er part of the Apple eaÅ¿ily to part with it's juice in the PreÅ¿s; therefore obÅ¿erve not the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral adviÅ¿e to preÅ¿s immediatly from the Mill.</p>
                     <p>You may leave a paÅ¿Å¿age open in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of your Fat, wherein you keep your bruiÅ¿ed Apples, during the time of their being therein, from the grinding to the preÅ¿Å¿ing; and Å¿ome of the Cyder may Å¿pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneouÅ¿ly deÅ¿till into a receiver placed under it, or you may have a falÅ¿e Bottom full of holes, that the greater quanty may be had which may run through Å¿ome Tap or other paÅ¿Å¿age into your receiver: Cyder thus ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained far excels that which is forced out by the PreÅ¿s; as Live Honey that deÅ¿tills of it Å¿elf from the Combs, is much better than that which remains and is preÅ¿Å¿ed out

                        <note place="margin">How to fine or clear Cyder.</note>Â§. 6. If your Cyder be not fine at the times aforementioned, try them again a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a Month after, and then if it be not fine, rack it off as you would do Wine, Å¿etting another VeÅ¿Å¿el in a convenient place, that through a pipe of Leather, or a Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon, or a Crane of Å¿ome metal, (as of Latten) or GlaÅ¿s, the Liquor may run out of the one into the other, without being expoÅ¿ed to the Air, which is a moÅ¿t ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial thing to take care of at all times, the Å¿pirits of Cyder being very apt to eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate.</p>
                     <p>Some chuÅ¿e rather to fine their Cyder with Water Glew, commonly call'd IÅ¿in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaÅ¿s, than by racking it. And the common and beÅ¿t way is that amongÅ¿t Vintners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that have frequent uÅ¿e for it; and it is to diÅ¿Å¿olve a conÅ¿iderable quantity of IÅ¿in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaÅ¿s
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:154132:115"/>in White Wine, without putting it on the fire, which it will do in about a Months time, and turn to a Jelly, which they keep by them, and it will keep good a Twelvemonth; and when they have occaÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to uÅ¿e it, remove the Scum that will be on the top of it, and take what quantity will Å¿erve their turn out of it, according to the proportion of a quart to a Hog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿head; and this they beat to a froth, and mix it with a quantity of the Liquor it's to be put in, and them pour it into the VeÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿el mixing it well together with a Broom, and Å¿o leaving the work.</p>
                     <p>Or if your Cyder hath Å¿tood long, and will not be fine, as oÅ¿tentimes it Å¿o hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth; Then take IÅ¿inglaÅ¿s about an Ounce to an HogÅ¿head, and Å¿teep it a day or two in about two quarts of Cyder untill the whole be reduced to a Gelly, which by Å¿tanding warm it will eaÅ¿ily do, then draw off about a Gallon of the Cyder, and mix the Gelly (being cold) throughly with it, and put the whole into the VeÅ¿Å¿el of Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the Bung, and with a Å¿plitted Å¿taff, Å¿tir it well together, and in a day or two it will be fine without any prejudice to your Cyder.</p>
                     <p>This way of purification will Å¿erve in all Å¿orts of Liquors, and is much to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred in the juices of Fruits, to that vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar way of making them to Ferment by the addition of YeaÅ¿t, or ToÅ¿ts therein dipt,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:154132:115"/>as is uÅ¿ually preÅ¿cribed; that being but an Acid excitation to Fermentation, all things tending to Acidity being (as much as may be) in our operations to be avoided.</p>
                     <p>This way alÅ¿o is better than the tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous way of Percolation, and racking from VeÅ¿Å¿el to VeÅ¿Å¿el, which waÅ¿ts not only the Spirits, but Å¿ubÅ¿tance of the Liquor it Å¿elf, and leaves you but a thin and flat drink, hardly ballancing your trouble.</p>
                     <p>When your Cyder is very fine, either draw it out of the VeÅ¿Å¿el as you drink it, or which is far better, Bottle it: And take notice after it is fine, the Å¿ooner you draw it off the better.</p>
                     <p>Â§. 7. Altho your Cyder be well made, yet if it be put into ill Å¿haped, corrupt,<note place="margin">Of VeÅ¿Å¿els for Cyder.</note> faulty, and unÅ¿ound VeÅ¿Å¿els, it's certainly Å¿poil'd. Altho the vulgar round Barrel be moÅ¿t uÅ¿eful, and neceÅ¿Å¿ary for TranÅ¿por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation from one place to another, yet is the upright VeÅ¿Å¿el, whoÅ¿e Ribs are Å¿treight, and the head about a fourth or fifth part broader than the bottom, and the height equal to the Diameter of the upper part, the beÅ¿t form to Å¿tand in a Cellar. The Bung-hole of about two Inches Diameter, is to be on the top with a Plug of Wood turn'd round exactly to fit into it, near unto which there muÅ¿t be a Å¿mall Vent-hole, that after the Cyder is tumn'd up, and Å¿topt at the Bung or Tun-hole, you may give it
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:154132:116"/>Vent at pleaÅ¿ure; and that when you draw it forth, you may there admit Air into the VeÅ¿Å¿el. This is call'd in <hi>LancaÅ¿hire,</hi> a Stand Barrel, becauÅ¿e it's made after the form of a VeÅ¿Å¿el which the meaner Å¿ort of People keep their drink in, call'd a Stand. This form is preferred; becauÅ¿e that moÅ¿t Liquors contract a skin, or cream on the top, which helps much their preÅ¿ervation, and is in other forms broken by the Å¿ink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Liquor, but in this is kept whole; which occaÅ¿ions the freÅ¿hneÅ¿s of the drink to the laÅ¿t.

                        <note place="margin">Choice of Bottles as Corks for Cyder.</note>Â§. 8. Thick, double GlaÅ¿s Bottles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining about quarts apiece, are preferr'd very much to Stone Bottles; becauÅ¿e that Stone Bottles are apt to Leak, and more apt to taint than the other, and are Å¿o rough in the mouth that they are not eaÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uncork'd, neither are they tranÅ¿parent, that you may diÅ¿cern when they are foul or clean; it being otherwiÅ¿e with GlaÅ¿s Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, whoÅ¿e defects are eaÅ¿ily diÅ¿cern'd, and are of a more compact metal, or Å¿ubÅ¿tance, not waÅ¿ting Å¿o many Corks. If GlaÅ¿s Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels happen to be muÅ¿ty, they are eaÅ¿ily cured, by boyling them in a VeÅ¿Å¿el of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, putting them in whilÅ¿t the Water is cold, which prevents the danger of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if you be Å¿o cautious as not to Å¿et them down Å¿uddenly on a cold Floor, but upon Straw, Board, or Å¿uch like.</p>
                     <p>If your GlaÅ¿s Bottles be foul, you may cleanÅ¿e them with hard Sand, or Å¿ome Lead-Shot (each about the bigneÅ¿s of an ordinary PeaÅ¿e) roll'd, and tumbled up and down with Water, which will alÅ¿o in Å¿ome degree take away the muÅ¿tineÅ¿s from them. Great
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:154132:118"/>care is to be had in chooÅ¿ing good Corks, much good Liquor being abÅ¿olutely Å¿poiled through the only defect of the Cork; If the Corks are Å¿teeped in Å¿calding Water a while before you uÅ¿e them, they will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply better with the mouth of the Bottle, than if forced in dry: alÅ¿o the moiÅ¿ture of the Cork doth advantage it in detaining the Spirits.</p>
                     <p>Â§.9. Drawing of Cyder into Bottles, and keeping it in them well Å¿topt for Å¿ome time,<note place="margin">Bottling of Cyder.</note> is a great improver of Cyder. This is done after it is throughly purified, and at any time of the year; if it be bottled early, there needs no addition, it having body and Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit enough to retrive in the Bottle what it loÅ¿t in the Barrel: But if it have been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-fermented, and thereby become poor, flat and eager, then in the Bottling if you add a Å¿mall quantity of Loaf Sugar, more or leÅ¿s according as it may require, it will give a new life to the Cyder, and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly make it better than ever it was before, eÅ¿pecially if it were but a little acid, and not Eager.</p>
                     <p>When your Cyder is thus Bottled, if it were new at the Bottling, and not abÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely pure, it is good to let the Bottles Å¿tand a while uncork't before you Å¿top them cloÅ¿e, or elÅ¿e open the Corks two or three days after, to give the Cyder Air, which will prevent the breaking the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:154132:118"/>againÅ¿t the next turning of the Wind to the South.</p>
                     <p>The meaner Cyder is more apt to break the Bottles than the richer; being of a more Eager nature, and the Å¿pirits more apt to fly, having not Å¿o Å¿olid a body to detain them as the rich Cyders.</p>
                     <p>ObÅ¿erve that when the Bottle breaks through the Fermentation of the Cyder, to open your Corks, and give vent, and Å¿top them up again a while after, leÅ¿t you loÅ¿e many for want of this caution. Lay your Bottles Å¿ideways, not only for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erving the Corks moiÅ¿t, but for that the Air that remains in the Bottle is on the Å¿ide of the Bottle, where it can neither expire, not can New be admitted, the Liquor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againÅ¿t the Cork, which not Å¿o eaÅ¿ily paÅ¿Å¿eth through the Cork, as the Air. Some place their Bottles on a Frame, with their mouth downwards for that end, which is not to be Å¿o well approved of, by reaÅ¿on that if there be any the leaÅ¿t Å¿ettling in the Bottle, you are Å¿ure to have it the firÅ¿t GlaÅ¿s.</p>
                     <p>Placing Bottles on a Frame, as is uÅ¿ual, or on Shelves, is not Å¿o good as on the Ground; by reaÅ¿on the farther from the Ground they Å¿tand, the more are they Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Variation of the Air, which is always more rare in the upper, than lower part of a Cellar, or other Room. Setting Bottles in Sand is much uÅ¿ed, but without
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:154132:119"/>reaÅ¿on, becauÅ¿e it adds not that coldneÅ¿s to the Bottles as is generally expected, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rather of a dry and temperate quality than cold.</p>
                     <p>The placing of Bottles in Wells, or in CiÅ¿terns of Spring Water running, or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often changed, is queÅ¿tionleÅ¿s the beÅ¿t way to preÅ¿erve either Ale, Cyder or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Vinous Liquor.</p>
                     <p>A ConÅ¿ervatory made where a continual recruit of a cool refrigatory Spring Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may conveniently be had, will Å¿o long preÅ¿erve Cyder untill it become to the Å¿trength even of Canary it Å¿elf.</p>
                     <p>Where you have not conveniency of Water, or are unwilling to be at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of making Å¿uch ConÅ¿ervatories, there the beÅ¿t way is to dig Vaults in your Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, under the level of the bottom, or to make Niches in the Walls near the Ground, and in them place your Bottles leaning: for the more they are from the Air, and the more they are encompaÅ¿Å¿ed with Stone or Earth, the cooler they will continue, and the leÅ¿s Å¿ubject to the inconveniences that happen from the mutability of the Ambient Air.</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>THere are PerÅ¿ons who perÅ¿wade themÅ¿elves that its a crime to add any thing to Antiquity, and who Å¿ay, That nothing can be invented of new more than what the Ancients have Å¿aid; and that it is a vain Glory and PreÅ¿umption to imagine we can Å¿ay any thing which has not been written. But if it were free for me to AnÅ¿wer this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, I would Å¿ay, That Arts are not of thoÅ¿e things to which nothing can be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and that the Older the World grows, the more they are carryed on to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Anatomy</hi> did not appear in Å¿o
<pb facs="tcp:154132:143"/>great a LuÅ¿ter in the Time of <hi>Galen,</hi> as in our Days: and the <hi>Art of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Fruit-trees</hi> was not Å¿o perfect in the Time of the <hi>Curate of Henonvil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le,</hi> as at preÅ¿ent. We are like a Dwarf on a Giants Å¿houlders. We Å¿ee much farther than our Fathers, and we dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diÅ¿cover things which they knew not. I will not Å¿ay for this, that there are not any precepts or Rules found for Pruning Trees in the <hi>Books of Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture and Gardening</hi> which have been Printed within Twenty or Five and Twenty Years, I candidly own that there are Å¿ome; but in truth they are Å¿o few in Number, and the greateÅ¿t part Å¿o obÅ¿cure, and Å¿o little to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly'd on, that I very much doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they may be followed without committing faults. If on the contrary you Å¿tick to thoÅ¿e which I give in this Tract; many Years experience has aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ur'd me, that Trees Prun'd according
<pb facs="tcp:154132:143"/>to the Rules which I EÅ¿tabliÅ¿h, will produce great Fruits in abundance. I have therefore reduc't <hi>The Art of Pruning Fruit-Trees</hi> into four Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and I have caus'd Å¿even Figures to be Grav'd which I Judg'd neceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ary for the underÅ¿tanding of what I Å¿ay: The firÅ¿t Chapter Treats of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Trees in the Month of <hi>February.</hi> The Å¿econd explains that of the beginning of <hi>May.</hi> The third teaches the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at the end of <hi>May</hi> and the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>June.</hi> LaÅ¿tly the Fourth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priÅ¿es the Pruning of <hi>July.</hi> I thought fit to reduce this Book into a form of precepts, without forming a continued DiÅ¿courÅ¿e; becauÅ¿e often we have need of one precept, without having need of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: and I have writ it after Å¿o popular a manner that the moÅ¿t Illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Gardiners might comprehend what I would Å¿ay.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> The Pruning or Lopping of Fruit-trees, for the Month of <hi>February.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>ALmoÅ¿t all Trees begin to Å¿prout forth in <hi>France</hi> toward the end of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>March;</hi> and this is the motion which we call the riÅ¿e of the Sap, or the Å¿hooting of Trees. This ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleÅ¿s happens variouÅ¿ly, the diÅ¿poÅ¿iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Air, the goodneÅ¿s of the Soil, the vigour or the kind of the Tree, make the Saps or Å¿hootings to come earlier or later: They come early in a dry year, and are backward in a moiÅ¿t.</p>
                        <p>This riÅ¿e of the Sap invites then Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to Prune or Lop Trees in the Month of <hi>February,</hi> which is the moÅ¿t proper time for this work; and tho' it may be done all the Winter, however the Moon be diÅ¿pos'd, Trees being then at reÅ¿t as to their Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; nevertheleÅ¿s it is much better to Å¿tay for this till the Colds are paÅ¿t, and that the Rains no longer infeÅ¿t the wounds which
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:154132:145"/>are made on Trees; by this means they Å¿eal themÅ¿elves in a little time, and Å¿oon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner cover the wound which has been made on them.</p>
                        <p>Before you Prune or Lop a Tree, you ought to conÅ¿ider the Å¿trength and kind of it for rendring it beautiful and fertile; for all Trees are not to be Lopt after the Å¿ame faÅ¿hion: We Lop diverly (for inÅ¿tance) a Peach-Tree and a Winter Pear-Tree; and its by Lopping of this laÅ¿t, that the skill of the Gardiner Å¿hews it Å¿elf the moÅ¿t con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿picuouÅ¿ly, and that we judge beÅ¿t of his ability.</p>
                        <p>There are Trees which we dare not Lop, by reaÅ¿on of the abundance of their Sap; for the more we Lop them, the more Wood they Å¿hoot forth, and the leÅ¿s Fruit; even the Flower-buds yield Wood, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens often to the Tree, which yields the delicate Pear call'd <hi>the little RouÅ¿Å¿elet;</hi> to the lateward <hi>Bergamot,</hi> to the <hi>VirgoleuÅ¿e,</hi> to the St. <hi>Lezan, &amp;c.</hi> But when theÅ¿e Å¿orts of Trees have Å¿hot forth their full, after this they bear but too much. In this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caÅ¿ion Lop Å¿ometimes Å¿hort, and Å¿ometimes long, or not at all: take away Å¿ometimes the young Wood, and preÅ¿erve the old; another while cut away the old, for the Tree to grow young again; at another time cut away the Branches, and all the falÅ¿e
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:154132:146"/>Sprouts, but remember never to diÅ¿garniÅ¿h the Stock, by Lopping away all the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Branches of the Å¿ides of the Tree, and making the Trunk bare.</p>
                        <p>Gardiners have a very true Maxim, <hi>Lop in fair Weather, in the decreaÅ¿e of the Moon, and in the end of the Saps, or rather when Trees are at rest.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The decreaÅ¿e of the Moon of <hi>January,</hi> which happens in <hi>February,</hi> is the true time for Lopping Trees, and for preÅ¿erving Grafts; not but this Rule has Å¿ome excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for weak Trees, and thoÅ¿e that are Planted but of that year, ought to be Lopt at the new Moon, to make them Å¿prout vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouÅ¿ly: And we muÅ¿t remember that Trees ought not to be cut when we Plant them, but we ought to Å¿tay till the Month of <hi>February</hi> following.</p>
                        <p>When you Plant a Graft of three years, which has Flower-buds, preÅ¿erve Å¿ome to Å¿ee the Fruit in the firÅ¿t year: It is of theÅ¿e Å¿orts of Trees that you muÅ¿t always make choice, they Å¿hew from their beginning an aÅ¿Å¿ured fruitfulneÅ¿s, and bear afterward a great deal of Fruit as long as they live.</p>
                        <p>BecauÅ¿e it is known that an abundance of Sap makes but Branches, and that a little or mean Sap makes Fruit: and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over that the Moon has leÅ¿s influence on Å¿ublunary things, when Å¿he begins to be in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:154132:146"/>the Wain, than when Å¿he IncreaÅ¿es; expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience has taught us that the decreaÅ¿e of the Moon is the moÅ¿t kindly time for Lopping Trees, which have then leÅ¿s of motion. The decreaÅ¿e is from the time of the Full to the New, nevertheleÅ¿s Å¿ome will have it that we may Lop Trees during the time that the Moon is not horned, that is to Å¿ay, from her eighth day to her one and Twentieth. They Å¿ay that it is not only the Moon which cauÅ¿es Fruit on Trees, but the diÅ¿poÅ¿ition of the Branches; and that it Å¿uffices that the Moon has Å¿trength, provided that on the other Å¿ide Å¿he finds in a Branch, Fibres tranÅ¿verÅ¿e and diÅ¿pos'd to cauÅ¿e Fruit-buds to be there form'd. True it is, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence has taught me that the Seeds of Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers caÅ¿t into the Earth during all this time, turn double Å¿ooner than thoÅ¿e that are Sown in another time.</p>
                        <p>We ought firÅ¿t to Lop Apricock, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctarin, and Peach-trees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauÅ¿e they Å¿hoot forth the firÅ¿t; the Winter Pear-trees follow next, after theÅ¿e thoÅ¿e of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn and of Summer, and the Portugal Quince-trees: We ought Å¿hortly after to Lop and Prune Plum-trees, and Apple-trees, and laÅ¿tly SpaniÅ¿h Pomegranet-trees, becauÅ¿e all theÅ¿e Trees Å¿hoot forth the one after the other; but above all, we ought not to Lop this laÅ¿t till it has Å¿hot forth a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:154132:147"/>little, that we may the better diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h the weak or dead Branches.</p>
                        <p>After the ObÅ¿ervations which we even now made, we ought to begin to Lop and Trim up a Tree by one of its Å¿ides from the lower part to the top, and we ought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward to carry on our Work without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuÅ¿ion, and to take one Branch after the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This Å¿ide being thus Lopt and paled, we deÅ¿cend on the other Å¿ide from the top to the bottom in the Å¿ame Order.</p>
                        <p>We muÅ¿t here remember always to cut the Branches in the form of a Hinds foot, Å¿o that the Sun may not dry the wound, which ought to be as far as we may on the North Å¿ide; but after Å¿uch a manner that the Å¿loping Å¿ide of the wound be not too Å¿traight downward, to the end that the knot be not endammag'd; otherwiÅ¿e the eye which ought to puÅ¿h forth wood, being cut too much by the Å¿lope of a too Å¿treight deÅ¿cent (chiefly in tender Trees) will not puÅ¿h forth at all or weakly, and will communicate ev'n to five or Å¿ix eyes the evil of a wound ill made.</p>
                        <p>We muÅ¿t further remember to cut always a Branch near a Wood-bud, and never near a Flower-bud; becauÅ¿e in this laÅ¿t Lop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, the Fruit which would come there, would not be Å¿ecured by the Leaves againÅ¿t the injury of the Air. Moreover the Branch
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:154132:147"/>would be expos'd to the Air, and finally the wound would not cloÅ¿e it Å¿elf, nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come to an EÅ¿char the Pears carrying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all the Sap, that ought to make it:</p>
                        <p>We ought not moreover to leave a Stub to a Branch which we cut at a Wood-bud, that we may give way to the Branch to cloÅ¿e it Å¿elf in a Å¿hort time by the Å¿prout that ought to grow there; I Å¿ay not the Å¿ame of a Branch which we cut an Eye or two from the Trunk; this may put forth near the Stub, which we leave there, Å¿ome Fruit. buds, or Å¿ome Branches which will have diÅ¿poÅ¿itions to produce them, at leaÅ¿t if the Branch be little or of a mean Å¿ize; for if it be great, it ought to be cut near the Tree. If in Lopping where we leave a Stub, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Å¿hoots forth there, the year follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Stub muÅ¿t be cut Å¿mooth to the Tree.</p>
                        <p>I Å¿peak not here only of Fruit with Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, we ought ev'n to leave a Stub to Fruits with Stones, not to make them puÅ¿h forth Wood there, for this is not their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, but to keep them from being cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the Weather, and not to cauÅ¿e them to puÅ¿h forth Gum there, which is their Sap, and in this occaÅ¿ion their Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Enemy.</p>
                        <p>When the little Branches are too con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd, care muÅ¿t be taken to cut them off
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:154132:148"/>an Eye or two from the main Branch, or near the Trunk as I have Å¿aid, both to disburthen the Tree, and to make it puÅ¿h forth Å¿ome Branches anew, but after Å¿uch a manner, that there be always room for placing the Sprig which will come.</p>
                        <p>We ought alÅ¿o to ObÅ¿erve that to fill out a Tree well, its Branches ought not to be diÅ¿tant from each other above a Fingers breadth.</p>
                        <p>You muÅ¿t never cut Fruit-buds whatever reaÅ¿ons are alledged thereon; Trees at that time do what they are ordain'd for, by diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing their Riches, and Nature gives us what we demand of her for recompence of our cares and Labours.</p>
                        <p>We know a Fruit-bud by its Figure, by the Å¿mall bearer where it comes, by the motion it makes in the Å¿hoot of the Tree or finally by the abundance of Leaves that accompany it.</p>
                        <p>If a little and long Branch be well Å¿tor'd with Flower-buds, do not cut any of them (I Å¿ay it once again) and do not Å¿o much as touch the Branch, wait rather till the Flowers are come forth of the Bud to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿troy them, or till the Fruit are kern'd to cut with SciÅ¿Å¿ars the Stems of the leaÅ¿t and worÅ¿t form'd; by this means you will not cut away the Bud which will produce o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:154132:148"/>Fruit the following years when the Branch has fortified it Å¿elf.</p>
                        <p>NevertheleÅ¿s, if for Å¿ome great reaÅ¿on, we are Obliged to cut Flower-buds in a Branch bared of Å¿hoots, for drawing thither the Sap, and to cauÅ¿e Å¿ome void Å¿pace to be fill'd, and that there are no other Branches found for Å¿upplying this Default, we muÅ¿t cut the Branch at a Wood-knot to fill out the Tree, and we muÅ¿t take good heed not to cut it near the Flower or Fruit-buds, for the reaÅ¿ons which we have mentioned, and after this we muÅ¿t take away the Fruit-buds to give it more Å¿trength to puÅ¿h forth.</p>
                        <p>The old Buds which have yielded Fruit for many years together, and which give us no longer hope of producing more, muÅ¿t be cut away to embelliÅ¿h the Tree, and to disburthen it of Å¿omewhat which is uÅ¿eleÅ¿s and Å¿uperfluous.</p>
                        <p>The bearers which are two, three, or four Inches long are the beÅ¿t, eÅ¿pecially when they IÅ¿Å¿ue from the great Branches near the top of the Tree; they bring forth many years one after the other, and bear very great Fruit. ThoÅ¿e which are bared of Branches laÅ¿t indeed a long time; but they do not bear Å¿o Beautiful Fruit, and often they are drain'd, unleÅ¿s you cut the Stems of the Pears with SciÅ¿Å¿ars; and thoÅ¿e which are
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:154132:149"/>not above a nail in length, and which come from the Trunk, bring forth very great Fruit; but ordinarily they laÅ¿t but a year</p>
                        <p>A Shoot of <hi>AuguÅ¿t</hi> never yields Fruit, the Wood is not then well fill'd with Sap, it ought always to be cut away, unleÅ¿s it be extreamly neceÅ¿Å¿ary for filling a void Å¿pace.</p>
                        <p>If a uÅ¿eleÅ¿s or irregular Branch grows be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, it is always cut away, ev'n tho' it has on it a Flower-bud; for the Fruit which would come of it, would be Å¿poil'd by the Å¿hadow of the Tree, and would be good for nothing: if it be before, we cut it an Eye or two from the Mother Branch, to try to make Å¿ome Flower-buds Å¿pring forth there.</p>
                        <p>A Branch bent by force bears much Fruit, but it is Å¿mall, unleÅ¿s it were plyed Å¿o the firÅ¿t year; the reaÅ¿on is evident, its Fibres are bent, and the Sap does not carry it Å¿elf briskly to it.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes forked Å¿prouts, or knots of Scions Å¿hoot forth from certain places of Trees, when they are Old and at a Å¿tand that they need to be cut to renew them. In this occaÅ¿ion we ought to cut at a good length a MaÅ¿ter Sprig in Pear-trees and Apple-trees, and to cut Å¿ome an Eye or two from the Mother Branch, and cut others near the Trunk, but in Necta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:154132:149"/>and Peach-trees, we ought to cut all the leÅ¿Å¿er Branches an Eye or two from the Mother Branch, and let the longeÅ¿t and Å¿treighteÅ¿t run on, tho' it would be the Å¿hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teÅ¿t way in theÅ¿e laÅ¿t Trees, to cut a great Branch near the Trunk, or to cut the Trees two or three Fingers breadth from the Earth to renew them.</p>
                        <p>You muÅ¿t cut one Branch Å¿hort betwixt two long to fill out the Tree. The year following the Å¿hort Branch muÅ¿t be cut long, and the long Å¿hort: It is the Å¿ecret to have much Fruit, and to preÅ¿erve Trees; there are Å¿ome who Å¿ay that a Tree Lopt after that manner is not agreeable to behold: but I deÅ¿ire them to Å¿tay to conÅ¿ider them till the Month of <hi>May;</hi> and I am well aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ur'd they will change their Å¿entiment.</p>
                        <p>A Tree is ordinarily compos'd of three Å¿orts of Branches, we find on it <hi>Ravenous</hi> or <hi>Prodigal, Indifferent,</hi> and <hi>Fertile.</hi>

Of theÅ¿e three Å¿orts of Branches, that is to Å¿ay, of the Prodigal, Indifferent, and Fertile, the Prodigal are always cut very Å¿hort at the firÅ¿t or Å¿econd knot, to make the Sap paÅ¿s to another Å¿ide of the Tree, and produce there Branches Indifferent or Fertile. This Lopping reiterated many times, makes the Prodigal Dye, or at leaÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e hinders the Tree from puÅ¿hing them Å¿o vigorouÅ¿ly. Its by reaÅ¿on of this experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that we ought not to cut Trees much, becauÅ¿e by cutting them in all their Branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, they are made to LanguiÅ¿h and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to Dye. The Prodigals which have been cut many times the precedent year, ought to be Lopt at the firÅ¿t knot near the Mother Branch whence it grows, as the Fourth Figure Å¿hews.</p>

                        <p>Lop therefore the top of the Tree, where the Prodigal Branches are Ordinarily found, and Å¿pread it at the bottom and at the Å¿ides; this Lopping gracefully fills a Tree, and hinders it from Growing to too great a height and from deÅ¿troying it Å¿elf in a Å¿hort time.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. As for the Indifferent Branches, Å¿ome
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:154132:153"/>of them ought to be Lopt, others not; that is to Å¿ay, we ought in the Month of <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi> to let thoÅ¿e grow on which have Buds for Wood very near each other, and which iÅ¿Å¿ue from a good place, as alÅ¿o thoÅ¿e which have two great Leaf-buds which touch each other at the end of the Branch; to the end we may know their Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us at the Lopping of <hi>June.</hi> The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eÅ¿t and beÅ¿t Å¿upply'd with Juice will be the beÅ¿t for keeping. The Indifferent which we ought to cut at the third or fourth knot, are thoÅ¿e which are leaÅ¿t diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to bear Fruit, and which have the Leaf-buds far from one another.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The Fertile ought never to be Lopt, tho' they are as long as the Arm; Trees left to run up from which we Lop no Branches and which bear Å¿o much Fruit, Å¿hew us well that we ought never to Lop the Fertile: nevertheleÅ¿s, if there be need of them for filling up a void Å¿pace where it happens, and that no other Branch can be found for this purpoÅ¿e, I permit them to be cut for embelliÅ¿hing the Tree.</p>
                        <p>And to explain my Å¿elf farther in Å¿peak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concerning a Fertile Branch, I Å¿ay that that which has Rings in its Å¿ource, Wrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les at the beginning of its Å¿hoot of <hi>May</hi> or of <hi>June,</hi> or finally knots near each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ought not to be cut without a great
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:154132:153"/>neceÅ¿Å¿ity; for experience has taught me that all theÅ¿e Branches bear Infallibly their Fruit toward the end of their Branches, which our ill Gardiners always cut away, So at the beginning of <hi>February</hi> ObÅ¿erve exactly the end of the Å¿hoots of the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent year, that you may always cut the Branch when the Saps are at a Å¿tand at the firÅ¿t or Å¿econd knot in the Wood which comes after, and to leave all the knots which will be as many Flower-buds, that will not fail to form themÅ¿elves there in two or three years. Its an ObÅ¿ervation which will embelliÅ¿h your Trees by the abundance of Fruits which they will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce. That which I Å¿ay being Å¿omewhat difficult to comprehend without Å¿eeing it, the fifth Figure will make you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tand it.</p>

In this occaÅ¿ion we muÅ¿t let run the better, and Lop the other at the firÅ¿t or Å¿econd knot. Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence has taught me that theÅ¿e Branches ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fail of bearing Fruit the Å¿econd or third year. See the third Figure.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the Å¿ame Experience has taught me that the Fruit-buds which come at the end of the Branches in Trees whoÅ¿e Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us is often to bear their Fruit in this place, ought not to be cut, eÅ¿pecially if they produce little, and we Å¿hould have but few <hi>Gracioli, Coins Francs,</hi> nor <hi>Grenades d'EÅ¿pagne,</hi> if we Å¿hould cut theÅ¿e Å¿orts of Trees at the end of their Branches.</p>
                        <p>It is Å¿aid that the Fruits which come at ends of Branches are Å¿mall, and that the Wind blows them down. I own that the firÅ¿t default is without remedy, but the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:154132:155"/>Second is not Å¿o, for we may bind up the Branch laden with Fruit againÅ¿t the Wind. Nature doing well what Å¿he does, when Å¿he places a Fruit-bud at the end of a Branch of a Pear-tree, has an intent to render this Branch Fertile; for the Fruit which Å¿he produces there, Å¿eals that Branch, and hinders it from puÅ¿hing forth afterward; this Branch receiving not then much Sap, forms in all its length an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of Fruit-buds, and two or three years after it is all deckt with them; which it continues to do for five or Å¿ix years following, till the Branch is worn out; if this Flower-bud be cut away the Sap will come freely and vigorouÅ¿ly into the Branch cut, and inÅ¿tead of the Fruit which Nature had there deÅ¿ign'd, we Å¿hall have nought but Wood through the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diners Ignorance.</p>
                        <p>When we will have larg Fruit, eÅ¿peci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the <hi>Bon-Chretien</hi> and in other Trees, which bear great, we ought to Lop Å¿hort, the nearer the Fruit-buds are to the Trunk, the greater the Fruit is, for it receives more of the Juice.</p>
                        <p>There are Gardiners who make the BuÅ¿h of a Tree too thin by cutting away the little Branches, and leaving the Trunk al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moÅ¿t bare: we might leave in it Å¿ome clear Å¿pace in the middle and the Å¿ides, to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:154132:155"/>give entrance to the Sun which muÅ¿t co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour the Pears, but we ought not to cut it too much: the Å¿hadow of the Leaves ought to Å¿ecure the Trunk of the Tree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t the parching heat of the Sun which makes it chop, and which breeds the Scab and the Canker by the dryneÅ¿s of its Bark. Tree it is that we ought to cut Å¿horter Trees with a round BuÅ¿h head than <hi>EÅ¿paliers,</hi> and that we ought not to let them run up too much: In a Å¿trong and moiÅ¿t Soil we muÅ¿t keep a BuÅ¿h head thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Branches than in another Soil, which is poor and dry; but in all places we ought to keep it well filled, and not cut away the Branches in the midÅ¿t of it as much as is done at this day.</p>
                        <p>The niceÅ¿t Trees do not delight in this Figure, Pear-trees do not much take to it, and Apricock-trees leÅ¿s. Trees Grafted on the great Quince-tree, are more proper for it than thoÅ¿e which are Grafted on a Pear-tree, theÅ¿e later cannot be reduc't, the more you cut them the more they Å¿hoot of Wood; and beÅ¿ides with this, they do not bring forth much Fruit, their nature being to be always high.</p>
                        <p>Cherry-trees which bear Å¿harp Cherries, grow very well with a BuÅ¿h head, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that they are Grafted on the Å¿mall bitter Cherry-tree; and they take to it
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:154132:156"/>better yet if they are permitted to grow up, for they do not much delight in the Pruning-knife, and leÅ¿s when they are old.</p>
                        <p>The Plum-tree is of the Å¿ame nature with the Cherry-tree; it is ordered alÅ¿o after the Å¿ame manner.</p>
                        <p>We ought rather to cut a Branch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, than to cut it in many places; the divers wounds which we give Trees, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay them, and make them dye languiÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, witneÅ¿s the <hi>Prodigal,</hi> which we kill by often cutting.</p>
                        <p>Experience has taught me for many years following, that Fruit with Å¿tones (that is to Å¿ay the Apricock-tree, the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctarin, and the Peach-tree) ought not to be Lop't as Pear-trees.</p>
                        <p>We ought only to cut away Branches, and Å¿ometimes the greateÅ¿t to make them renew themÅ¿elves: and contrary to the cuÅ¿tome of other Trees, they bear in young Å¿hoots which lade themÅ¿elves with Fruit the firÅ¿t year. Its after this manner that they laÅ¿t Twenty or Thirty years; the more therefore that a Peach-tree Å¿hoots forth, the more Fruit it bears.</p>
                        <p>We never ought in theÅ¿e Sorts of Trees to cut a Branch in the middle, tho' the Apricock-tree is not Å¿o much damnified by it as the others; becauÅ¿e they have a larg
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:154132:156"/>Pith very Å¿uÅ¿ceptible of the injuries of the Air. The wound often cauÅ¿es five or Å¿ix knots to dye in a Branch, which has been cut after that manner, and by taking off with the Pruning-knife the end of the Branch, as is ordinarily done, we carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way at the Å¿ame time the Fruit that ought to form it Å¿elf there, and we leave but an end of a Branch which brings nought but Wood.</p>
                        <p>I Å¿ay it once again; the Fruit comes but at the end of the Å¿hoot of the two firÅ¿t Saps; if we Lop away this end, we car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry away the Fruit, and we blockiÅ¿hly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive our Å¿elves of that which we Å¿eek with Å¿o much paÅ¿Å¿ion. Its a remark which we ought well to ObÅ¿erve, for the Sap ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Å¿pent and as it were wearied it Å¿elf after having paÅ¿t all along a Branch, does not exert it Å¿elf with Å¿o much vigour, and its motion is not Å¿o impetuous, nor Å¿o nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the end of a Branch as in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it; alÅ¿o it employs it Å¿elf rather to form Buds for Flowers when it acts mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, than when it agitates it Å¿elf with Å¿o much praecipitation.</p>
                        <p>BecauÅ¿e Fruit with Stones Å¿hoot more briskly and more in confuÅ¿ion than Pear-trees, we muÅ¿t alÅ¿o take good heed to Lop them with diÅ¿cretion. TheÅ¿e Trees having Å¿hot forth vigorouÅ¿ly a Branch during one
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:154132:157"/>year, and having produced Fruit there, loÅ¿e their force in this Å¿ame Branch the year following, and Å¿hoot forth nought but Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons here and there, but which are laden with an infinite number of Fruit; and the greateÅ¿t part of theÅ¿e Å¿ame Scions dye the year following as well as all the annual buds of the Tree. When a great Branch is old we ought to cut it in its Source, as you may Å¿ee in the Figure following.</p>

                        <p>The Nectarine and the Peach-tree, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the nature of thoÅ¿e Trees which Å¿hoot much in their tops, we muÅ¿t not hope to be able to Å¿ubdue them as Pear-trees, and force them to fill themÅ¿elves well in the lower part: if we Lop them as theÅ¿e Trees, that is to Å¿ay, if we Lop their Branches in the middle we hinder them indeed from Å¿hooting in their tops, but they do not fill themÅ¿elves for this in their low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part; they mount always, and by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them after that manner, no Fruit comes of it, and we kill them in a Å¿hort time.</p>
                        <p>In general, the Plum-tree and the Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-tree delight more in Lopping than the Apple-tree: but all three of them do not delight in it as much as the Pear-tree, which is the only Tree that endures it beÅ¿t. We muÅ¿t take nought from theÅ¿e three firÅ¿t Trees but the dead Wood, unleÅ¿s we will form them at firÅ¿t for <hi>BuÅ¿h-trees</hi> or <hi>EÅ¿pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>BecauÅ¿e the Corand-tree has much Pith, and that it comes eaÅ¿ily of a Å¿lip, its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture does not endure it to be Lopt in the middle of its Branches, no more than the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:154132:158"/>Peach-tree; above all we muÅ¿t take good care of cutting it, when we Å¿et it. We ought in an old Corand-tree to cut near the Root a Branch paÅ¿t bearing, in order to renew it, and to cut alÅ¿o from the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part Å¿ome young Å¿hoots of the year to hinder it from being too much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd. The young Å¿hoots which we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erve, Å¿erve to renew it when we cut it in its old Wood. NevertheleÅ¿s, tho' it does not delight in being Lopt, we make BuÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of it, and form it in an EÅ¿palier, which is beautiful to behold, at the time that it is laden with Fruit.</p>
                        <p>I Å¿ay the Å¿ame of the Mulberry-tree, and of the Fig-tree, which cannot endure the knife by reaÅ¿on of the abundance of their Pith; the laÅ¿t eÅ¿pecially is viÅ¿ibly damnified by it, unleÅ¿s we Lop from them great uÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿s Branches, for rendring them regular: and neither of them can be made to grow low, they love too much the free and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Air.</p>
                        <p>Medlar-trees and Service-trees natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grow high, the former endure the knife much more than the latter.</p>
                        <p>The Portugal Quince-trees, and the Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granate-trees of <hi>Spain</hi> will not be Lopt, becauÅ¿e they bear their Fruit at the end of their Branches. NevertheleÅ¿s we may take from them entire Branches, which cauÅ¿e a
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:154132:159"/>confuÅ¿ion, and which are old; and cut near the Trunk the uÅ¿eleÅ¿s Prodigals, which are uÅ¿ual enough in theÅ¿e Å¿orts of Trees. As for the other Prodigals which embelliÅ¿h the Tree, and which in four or five years will yield Fruit, we ought not to Lop them.</p>
                        <p>Care muÅ¿t be taken to cover the great Wounds of Trees with a PlaiÅ¿ter made of a pound of <hi>Drogue a flambeau,</hi> four Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of RoÅ¿ine, and two Ounces of Sheeps Sewet. When we walk in our Garden in a fine day of the Month of <hi>April,</hi> we muÅ¿t have in our hand a Magdaleon of the Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ter ev'n now mentioned, we muÅ¿t cut a little of it with a knife, and after having wrought it betwixt the moiÅ¿tn'd Fingers, for rendring it a little Å¿oft, we muÅ¿t apply it on the great Wounds, which we had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got to Å¿eal in the Month of <hi>March.</hi> And to the end that this PlaiÅ¿ter may keep the longer on the Wounds, we muÅ¿t put on it a bit of paper as a binder, which we muÅ¿t preÅ¿s on Å¿oftly with the Finger, to the end that the heat of the Summer making the PlaiÅ¿ter melt, the paper may preÅ¿s it, Å¿tay it, and glew it more to the Wood: it is what we ought to do in the two other Loppings following.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>IN the DecreaÅ¿e of the Moon of <hi>May,</hi> which happens often in <hi>June,</hi> you muÅ¿t Lop Trees for the Å¿econd time; but with more moderation than in <hi>February:</hi> for we ought never in <hi>June</hi> to cut great Branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and properly Å¿peaking, it is but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopping of Trees.</p>
                        <p>We muÅ¿t wait above all till the Sap be ended, according to the Maxim which we have alleag'd before, and it will be good to repeat it here: <hi>Lop in Fair wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the DecreaÅ¿e of the Moon, at the end of the Saps; or rather when Trees are at reÅ¿t.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The reÅ¿t of a Tree is known by a bud GarniÅ¿h't ordinarily with two Leaves, which forms it Å¿elf at the end of the Branches, and we obÅ¿erve chiefly this bud at the end of <hi>May,</hi> or at the beginning of <hi>June,</hi> that is to Å¿ay, after the firÅ¿t Sap or Å¿hooting.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="34" facs="tcp:154132:161"/>The Å¿econd Sap or Å¿hooting of Trees begins ordinarily in the middle of <hi>June,</hi> and ends a Month after, towards <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen</hi>-tide, Å¿o that betwixt the end of the firÅ¿t Sap, and the beginning of the Å¿econd there is about a Month: and its at this time that we muÅ¿t cut Trees again.</p>
                        <p>The effect of this re-cutting is to make the Buds of the firÅ¿t Sap to fill up, to force Trees to make Fertile Branches, or to form Flower-buds for the following year; whereas the Lop of <hi>February,</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿hes but Wood to yield Fruit three years after, if we except the <hi>Orange,</hi> the <hi>Berga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mot,</hi> the <hi>Double-flower,</hi> the <hi>Summer Bon-Chretien,</hi> and Å¿ome others.</p>
                        <p>You ought here to call to mind that we have diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿ht the Branches of Trees Into <hi>Prodigals, Indifferent</hi> and <hi>Fertile.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There are few Trees Grafted on cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Trees, and on Trees come of Kernels, which do not yield Å¿ome <hi>Prodigal</hi> in the firÅ¿t Sap, and which do not continue even to yield of them in the others. Care muÅ¿t be taken therefore to cut them at the Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Leaf-bud, and thus to correct the Å¿hoot which tranÅ¿ports it Å¿elf, and which draw a great part of the Sap of the Tree.

                        <p>As for Trees Grafted on the great Quince trees, they have not often of theÅ¿e Å¿orts o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <pb n="35" facs="tcp:154132:161"/>Prodigal Å¿hoots: and Å¿ome Gardiners are ev'n of the mind that they ought not to be Lopt at this time, and that the tops of them ought only to be pincht off with the Nails.</p>
                        <p>We muÅ¿t not deal with the Indifferent Branches as with the Prodigal: for we ought to keep the beÅ¿t without touching them, and obÅ¿erve exactly thoÅ¿e which we permitted to run on in the Month of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary.</hi> If theÅ¿e have good marks for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Fertile, we muÅ¿t cut nothing there; but if they have not, they muÅ¿t be cut Å¿hort enough to make them yield Å¿ome; that is to Å¿ay, they muÅ¿t be cut at the fifth or Å¿ixth knot for Leaves: As for the other <hi>Indifferents,</hi> we ought to cut them at half a foot, or ev'n a foots length, for rendring them Fertile the year follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The <hi>Indifferents</hi> which we muÅ¿t not cut, have particular marks which we have obÅ¿erv'd in the firÅ¿t Chapter.</p>
                        <p>We ought not to touch the Fertile Branches for the reaÅ¿ons mentioned elÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, unleÅ¿s it be Å¿ometimes thoÅ¿e which IÅ¿Å¿ue from a Flower-bud which has fail'd.</p>
                        <p>Before I paÅ¿s farther, it will be proper for me to explain my Å¿elf on what I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to Å¿ay by a Flower-bud which has fail'd; and you muÅ¿t give me leave to make two Å¿orts of Flower-buds. One Å¿ort is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:154132:162"/>and never Å¿hoots forth Wood: they are theÅ¿e which will yield Fruit in a Å¿hort time. The others Å¿hoot forth Wood when the Sap abounds too much, or when we cut a Tree too Å¿hort, and that by this means we draw the Sap too much toward theÅ¿e Å¿orts of Buds. They are theÅ¿e Buds which will not blow under two or three years. Their Origine, their Å¿ituation, and their-Figure make them eaÅ¿ily diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to a Gardiner which has experience and a good Å¿ence. This being thus eÅ¿tabliÅ¿ht, I may Å¿ay that a Scion which Å¿hoots in a Fruit-bud which has fail'd, is Å¿ituated in a good place for being called Fertile as I have Å¿aid it elÅ¿ewhere; and that if the Sap of the Tree had not been Å¿o abundant, to make this Bud Å¿hoot which yielded the Scion, doubtleÅ¿s this Bud would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the year following a Flower-bud; beÅ¿ides the Fibres of the Bud being tranÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿e, cauÅ¿e the Sap to circulate more Å¿lowly, and during all this time the Sun concocts and digeÅ¿ts the humour to form there Fruit-buds for Fruit.</p>
                        <p>I thought good to alledge all this, to Å¿hew the errour wherein Å¿ome are, who will have us always to cut this Scion, ev'n when the Fruit has fail'd, and for this they call it a falÅ¿e and an ill Å¿hoot. But experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence has taught me that it has marks of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:154132:162"/>FertileneÅ¿s, and that two years, or at far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theÅ¿t three years afterward, if it were not cut away, it would furniÅ¿h it Å¿elf with Flower-buds; and would bear during Å¿ix or Å¿even years an infinite number of Fruit.</p>
                        <p>If therefore the Flower-bud which is on a little bearer, that has fail'd, which would yield Fruit the next year or two years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Å¿hoots Wood; it ought to be cut Å¿hort in <hi>June,</hi> to make it form there Fruit-buds, which happens Å¿ometimes otherwiÅ¿e through the abundance of the Sap; for a Scion or two form themÅ¿elves there as may be Å¿een in the third Figure.</p>
                        <p>NevertheleÅ¿s, there are Å¿ome who will not have us to cut this Scion in <hi>June;</hi> they preÅ¿erve it for the Fruit, and cut it long in the Month of <hi>February</hi> following, or do not Lop them at all; and if there are two, they let the beÅ¿t grow, and cut the other an Eye or two from the Mother-Branch.</p>
                        <p>But however, I think we muÅ¿t here diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h two Å¿orts of Scions which come in a Flower-bud which has fail'd. There are bearers and vigorous Buds, which Å¿hoot forth two or three Scions, whereof Å¿ome are long and Å¿lender, others Å¿hort and Å¿lender, and others again Å¿hort and thick: We muÅ¿t not touch theÅ¿e laÅ¿t; becauÅ¿e moÅ¿t commonly a Flower-bud forms it Å¿elf there,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:154132:163"/>and we muÅ¿t not always cut the others an Eye or two from the Mother-Branch: If Å¿ome diÅ¿poÅ¿ition for a Flower-bud forms it Å¿elf near the Scion, cut within an Eye or two of the Mother-Branch, we muÅ¿t ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of it from the liberal hand of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; if none be form'd there, and that another Scion grows there, they muÅ¿t be left for the Months of <hi>July</hi> or <hi>February</hi> following. If the Bud which produces the Scion, be weak, we muÅ¿t not touch it, but we muÅ¿t preÅ¿erve the Scion for the Fruit, at leaÅ¿t if it appears well furniÅ¿ht with Sap in <hi>AuguÅ¿t;</hi> for if we cut it, it will be at a Å¿tand and will not Å¿hoot.</p>
                        <p>We muÅ¿t cut larger in <hi>June</hi> than in <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary;</hi> becauÅ¿e it is at that time that we give the Figure to the Tree for the year following, and that we cauÅ¿e Fruit-buds to be form'd for two years after.</p>
                        <p>If Grafts within a cleft made in the top of a Stock; are vigorous the year that they are Grafted, it is better (as Å¿ome think) to pinch the ends of them away with the Nails at the beginning of <hi>June,</hi> than to cut them. But experience has taught me that if we deÅ¿ign a Graft which Å¿hoots vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouÅ¿ly either for a BuÅ¿h head or for an <hi>EÅ¿palier,</hi> we ought to cut it at the New of the Moon, three or four Months after it is Grafted, to make it Å¿pread below,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:154132:163"/>and to Å¿ecure it from the Wind: We gain a year by Å¿o doing.</p>
                        <p>As for Trees which we deÅ¿ign to let run up to a height it will be good not to cut them at all till the Å¿econd year.</p>
                        <p>We muÅ¿t not touch the firÅ¿t year a Bud Grafted, be it never Å¿o vigorous; we muÅ¿t wait the year following to cut the Stump of the Tree come of Seed, mean while care muÅ¿t be taken to Å¿tay it up againÅ¿t the Wind.</p>
                        <p>I repeat it once again here, that we ought never to cut Flower-buds, becauÅ¿e we take away the Buds which bring a great deal of Fruit during Å¿ix or Å¿even years fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. When the little Branches, where the Buds are fixt, are fortified by the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s of the Tree, it is then that we muÅ¿t no longer cut off with Sheers, neither Flowers nor Pears.</p>
                        <p>There are Å¿ome who Å¿ay, that we ought to cut Apricock, Nectarin and Peach-trees, four or five times a year, to wit, in <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi> in <hi>May,</hi> in <hi>June,</hi> and in <hi>July:</hi> but Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience has taught me, as well as Father <hi>FeÃ¼illant,</hi> who has writ of Fruit-trees, that theÅ¿e Å¿orts of Trees do not much love the knife; otherwiÅ¿e, they do not laÅ¿t long, and we deÅ¿troy them in the end, by much cutting them: We are oblig'd in this Month to nale them up, and to cut at the Å¿ame
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:154132:164"/>time the Branches which cannot be apply'd to the EÅ¿palier. Some preÅ¿erve them to be cut in the Month of <hi>February,</hi> according to the Maxim that theÅ¿e Å¿orts of Trees, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very nice, do not love to be cut, or rather, they pull away with the Finger the Branches, as faÅ¿t as they come againÅ¿t or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and in an Irregular place.</p>
                        <p>After the firÅ¿t Lopping of <hi>February,</hi> I am not of opinion that we ought to cut any thing from Apple-trees, or Plum-trees, or Cherry-trees, or Goosberry-trees, or Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal Quince-trees, or SpaniÅ¿h Pomegranate-trees, unleÅ¿s we take from theÅ¿e two laÅ¿t Trees Å¿ome <hi>Prodigals,</hi> which ordinaly grow there, and which do not fill, nor embelliÅ¿h the Tree.</p>
                        <p>Tho' I reÅ¿olv'd to Å¿peak here but of Lop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Trees, nevertheleÅ¿s it may be allow'd me to Å¿ay Å¿omewhat curious concerning their watering, which contributes much to the abundance and greatneÅ¿s of their Fruit.</p>
                        <p>It will be proper in the Evening at Sun Å¿et, during the great heats of the Summer to Å¿prinkle with Water Å¿ometimes the Branches and the Fruit of Trees with a <hi>Dutch</hi> Pump. The Tree will be greener, and the Fruit better Å¿upply'd with nouriÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: it is far better to do Å¿o than to Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them at the Root; for this laÅ¿t wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering renders Peats unÅ¿avory, and of an ill
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:154132:164"/>taÅ¿te, whereas the firÅ¿t, anÅ¿wering to an Evening Rain, or the due of the Night, keeps the Tree Å¿upply'd with nouriÅ¿hment, which afterwards gives its Fruit the Juice, which is meat for them, for rendring them good and delicious.</p>
                        <p>For this we ought to ObÅ¿erve that the Water which we will make uÅ¿e of, ought to be drawn in the Morning, and to have been a little expos'd to the Sun, Å¿o that it Å¿hould not be cold in the Evening when we would uÅ¿e it: Moreover that the Pump has three or four little holes, that it may make the Water which iÅ¿Å¿ues from it to divide it Å¿elf into a ThouÅ¿and little drops. Finally, that we ought to place our Å¿elves at fifteen or twenty Foot from the Tree which we will Water.</p>

                        <p>WE Å¿aid in the foregoing Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that the Å¿econd Sap or Å¿hoot began in the middle of <hi>June,</hi> and ended at the end of <hi>July;</hi> and we Å¿ay at preÅ¿ent, that the third manifeÅ¿ts it Å¿elf in the Month of <hi>AuguÅ¿t,</hi> and Å¿ometimes in the Month of <hi>September</hi> according to the diÅ¿poÅ¿ition of the Air, and the difference of the Å¿eaÅ¿ons: Å¿o that it is at the end of the Å¿econd Sap that we ought to meddle with Trees; for in the Month of <hi>AuguÅ¿t</hi> we muÅ¿t take good heed not to cut any thing there, and if we cut then any Branch, the Wound does not cicatrize it Å¿elf all the year, the heat drys it, and the approaching Winter incommodes it with the exceÅ¿s of its Rains and colds.</p>

                           <pb n="43" facs="tcp:154132:165"/>If we ought to be Å¿crupulous in the Month of <hi>June</hi> to Lop Trees, we ought to be Å¿o for a much greater reaÅ¿on this Month, for at preÅ¿ent we muÅ¿t but pinch away with the nails the ends of, or cut a little Å¿ome Branches.</p>
                        <p>We muÅ¿t chooÅ¿e then in <hi>July</hi> a fine day and the decreaÅ¿e of the Moon to viÅ¿it the Trees: and we muÅ¿t call to mind the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viÅ¿ion which we have made of the Branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Trees.</p>
                        <p>We muÅ¿t Lop again at the Å¿econd knot the Prodigals a third time, if they have Å¿hot vigorouÅ¿ly, that we may wound Å¿o often the Branch which receives much of Sap, that its divers Wounds may weaken it, and divert by this means the Sap to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, that it may be divided into many Branches. TheÅ¿e Prodigals come not much but in Trees Grafted on the Pear-tree; and Planted in a good Soil, as I have Å¿aid: and Å¿o we muÅ¿t not Å¿eek for them elÅ¿ewhere, for thoÅ¿e which are Graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on the great Quince-tree do not Å¿hoot much: and in this Month we ought to cut nothing in theÅ¿e laÅ¿t Å¿orts of Trees.</p>
                        <p>In this Month we muÅ¿t not touch the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Branches, which we judg'd to be Å¿o in the Months of <hi>February</hi> and of <hi>June,</hi> we muÅ¿t Å¿tay till the Month of <hi>February</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing to Lop them, if they ought to be Lopt.</p>

                           <pb n="44" facs="tcp:154132:166"/>Neither muÅ¿t we touch of thoÅ¿e which are Fertile: but concerning thoÅ¿e which iÅ¿Å¿ue from a Flower-bud which has faild, there are differing Å¿entiments. The Å¿hoot which iÅ¿Å¿ues from this Bud having been cut at the Å¿econd knot in the Month of <hi>June,</hi> Å¿hoots Å¿ometimes at the Å¿econd Sap, and yields one or two Scions. Some will have it that we Å¿hould cut theÅ¿e alÅ¿o at the Å¿econd knot: becauÅ¿e they pretend that Nature ought to form there Å¿ome diÅ¿poÅ¿ition to make Buds. Others Lop at the Å¿econd Eye the leaÅ¿t, and preÅ¿erve the faireÅ¿t and beÅ¿t fed and knotted, to Å¿ee in <hi>February</hi> following if it will Å¿hew its Genius, and at that time they leave it all entire, becauÅ¿e it comes from a Fertile place, or cut it very long. They have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erv'd by experience that three years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards it brings a great many Buds, whence iÅ¿Å¿ue an infinite number of Fruit.</p>
                        <p>If in this Month there are found Å¿ome uÅ¿eleÅ¿s Branches beÅ¿ides, they muÅ¿t be cut an Eye or two from the Mother-Branch, to make them Å¿hoot forth Å¿omewhat that is good.</p>
                        <p>There come often on Peach and Necta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin-trees, and Å¿ometimes on Pear-trees a cluÅ¿ter of Branches, which happens often to Trees grown old, and fit to be cut for renewing themÅ¿elves. We muÅ¿t do at this
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:154132:166"/>time as we did in the <hi>February</hi> before: that is to Å¿ay, we muÅ¿t make choice of the MaÅ¿ter Sprig to preÅ¿erve it, and cut away the others. NevertheleÅ¿s there are Å¿ome who Å¿tay till the Month of <hi>February</hi> enÅ¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to do this, becauÅ¿e that in <hi>July</hi> the heat penetrates to the quick into the Wounds of nice Trees; and beÅ¿ides that which Trees Å¿hoot after this Å¿eaÅ¿on ought not to be preÅ¿erv'd. They cut therefore Trees at this time the leaÅ¿t they can, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying doubtleÅ¿s on experience which has obliged them Å¿o to do.</p>
                        <p>Toward Magdelan-tide, in the DecreaÅ¿e of the Moon, which happens in the Month of <hi>July,</hi> we muÅ¿t nail up again Peach-trees, Nectarin-trees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and we muÅ¿t cut all the Branches which are not flexible, and which are grown contrary to Order, tho' with this diligence, that we muÅ¿t cover as Å¿oon as may be with a PlaiÅ¿ter, and paper the Wounds which have been there made.</p>
                        <p>ThoÅ¿e who are for the laÅ¿ting of theÅ¿e Trees, pale them up at this time, but they Å¿tay to cut them till the Month of <hi>February;</hi> theÅ¿e Å¿orts of Trees (according to their Å¿entiment) being Å¿o nice, that they cannot endure the Summer, the great heat penetrating into their Wounds, cauÅ¿es five or Å¿ix Eyes to dye. Which we perceive dryed the year following:
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:154132:167"/>this is the way (Å¿ay they) to make them laÅ¿t forty years, as experience Å¿hews it. They choÅ¿e much rather (as I have Å¿aid) to pull away with the Finger, as they walk, the Branches which come contrary to order, than to cut them, and if there are found Å¿ome which ought to be cut, they keep them for the Month of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi> following. NevertheleÅ¿s, if they are too much confus'd, and that their Å¿had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow hinders the Sun from heating the Fruit, we Å¿hall be oblig'd to cut them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
                        <p>The abundance of Pears being ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily the Enemy of EÅ¿paliers, and making the Trees often dye, we muÅ¿t cut with Sheers the middle of the Å¿talk of the Pears, to disburthen the Trees. This ought to be done when the Fruit is a quarter or a third part as big as it ought. This Rule is only for great Winter-Fruit, and chiefly for the <hi>Bon-Chretien:</hi> we muÅ¿t obÅ¿erve al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿o not to leave above one or two Pears on a weak Branch, a Å¿trong one being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to bear more.</p>
                        <p>Its alÅ¿o in this Month that Fruit enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Juice, and begin to take a colour through the light of the Sun: but becauÅ¿e often there are Leaves, which hinder the rayes fron touching the Fruit, care muÅ¿t be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in <hi>July</hi> to take away Å¿ome from before
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:154132:167"/>them, and in the Month of <hi>AuguÅ¿t</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing we muÅ¿t cut away the reÅ¿t with Sheers, Å¿o managing the Light by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on of the burning heat of the Sun.</p>

                     <p>IT is not enough for us to have Writ con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Lopping of Trees, to have Fruit in abundance, we muÅ¿t alÅ¿o teach the way and the time of eating them without being offended thereby.</p>
                     <p>If our Stomach were as good as that of our Fore-fathers, it would be uÅ¿eleÅ¿s for us to Write on this matter; but becauÅ¿e it is weakn'd by the pleaÅ¿ures which men of late have taken in their way of living, there Å¿eems and Obligation upon us to give precepts concerning the uÅ¿e of Fruits, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for preÅ¿erving us in Health, or for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿troying our DiÅ¿eaÅ¿es when we are afflicted with them.</p>
                     <p>There is nothing Å¿o uÅ¿efull in PhyÅ¿ick, as to know the qualities of things which we make uÅ¿e of in Life, either for avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:154132:170"/>thoÅ¿e which offend us, or for taking thoÅ¿e which do us good: it is what has o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blig'd Learned men to deliver their Å¿enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments concerning all that we eat, they making uÅ¿e always of ReaÅ¿on and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which we Å¿hall alÅ¿o follow in this Tract of <hi>The uÅ¿e of Fruits of Trees:</hi> for it is only of thoÅ¿e whereof we deÅ¿ign to Å¿peak.</p>
                     <p>We Å¿hall make therefore three different Chapters: We Å¿hall Å¿hew in the FirÅ¿t the time and the way of uÅ¿ing thoÅ¿e Fruits which are eaÅ¿ily corrupted, as <hi>Figgs, Nectarins, Peaches, Plums, Apricocks, Mulberries,</hi> and <hi>Cherries,</hi> which we ought always to eat faÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, on an empty Stomach, and before Meals.</p>
                     <p>The Å¿econd Å¿hall Treat of thoÅ¿e which are not eaÅ¿ily corrupted, and which we ought to eat the laÅ¿t thing after Meals, as <hi>Pears, Apples, Portugal Quinces, Medlars,</hi> and <hi>Services.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>LaÅ¿tly, the third Å¿hall explain how we may eat before or after Meals <hi>RaiÅ¿ins, Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal and China Oranges, SpaniÅ¿h Pomegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates,</hi> and <hi>Corands.</hi> But before I enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this matter, I think fit to lay down Å¿ome general Maxims, without which we cannot know the good uÅ¿e which we ought to make of Fruits.</p>
                     <p>We ought then in the firÅ¿t place to obÅ¿erve all the qualities of the Fruits before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:154132:171"/>that we may uÅ¿e the one and the others at divers times, according to the precepts which we Å¿hall give in the Sequel.</p>
                     <p>We find of Sweet, of Sugar'd, of Amber'd, of Musked, of Vinous, of Aqueous or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ipid, of Sharp, of Acerb, and of AuÅ¿tere, and to Å¿peak in a few words, there are of Å¿weet, Å¿harp, and auÅ¿tere.</p>
                     <p>There are found moreover of Red, of Yellow, of Green, of Tawny, of Violet, of White and of Black.</p>
                     <p>Again there are of <hi>CaÅ¿Å¿ans</hi> or harÅ¿h, of <hi>Burez,</hi> of Fondans or melting and tender; fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally we find Å¿uch as paÅ¿s quickly through the Bowels of thoÅ¿e that eat them, and theÅ¿e are the Fruits which are eaÅ¿ily corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: there are others which Å¿tay a long time in the Stomach, and they are thoÅ¿e which are corrupted with difficulty.</p>
                     <p>All the Fruits whereof we deÅ¿ign to Å¿peak in particular, cool and moiÅ¿ten much, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e they are but Water gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and paÅ¿Å¿ed through the Trunk of the Tree, which produces them; but neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿s with this difference, that there are Å¿ome colder and moiÅ¿ter than others.</p>
                     <p>Fruit that have a quality which is Å¿weet, and pleaÅ¿ant to the taÅ¿te, are leÅ¿s cold than others: thus, tho' Figgs, RaiÅ¿ins, the <hi>Bon-ChrÃªtien,</hi> the SpaniÅ¿h Renet, and other Fruit of the like nature, moiÅ¿ten much, they have
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:154132:171"/>nevertheleÅ¿s but a coldneÅ¿s, which does not paÅ¿s the bounds of the firÅ¿t degree, its for this reaÅ¿on that they dulcifie much, and that they nouriÅ¿h a little more than the others, their matter having more affinity with our parts. But if with their natural Å¿weetneÅ¿s they have an odour of Amber or of Musk, then they have I know not what Å¿ubtle and penetrating parts, which exhilerate our Heart and Brain, and which make us di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geÅ¿t them better than others.</p>
                     <p>Sharp Fruit cool more than Å¿weet: but they do not moiÅ¿ten Å¿o much, they power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully penetrate and attenuate the thick and earthy matters, Å¿o that afterward they are no longer capable of doing us hurt. They qualifie our heated Bowels; they deÅ¿troy the Flame there, which often all the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of PhyÅ¿ick have not been able to quench during many Months: they cool our Liver, remove all the ObÅ¿tructions of our Bowels, and give our Blood a more free motion: finally they appeaÅ¿e fluxions, if we apply them outwardly, and they Å¿tay a Flux of Blood from whatever part it comes.</p>
                     <p>Fruits which are auÅ¿tere and acerb, and which differ but in more or leÅ¿s, reÅ¿tringe the Tongue and the Palate when we eat them: it Å¿eems that they Å¿top the Orifices of the threads that terminate there, by the blunted and obtuÅ¿e particles of their matter.</p>

All theÅ¿e Fruits are alÅ¿o more cold than the Å¿weet and the Amb'red, but they do not moiÅ¿ten Å¿o much: and becauÅ¿e their Å¿avour is in a more Earthy matter, ev'n in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pect they do not penetrate Å¿o much as the Sharp.

                     <p>After all, a Fruit which has been brought to perfection by the heat of the Sun, and which has not been Å¿hadowed by the Leaves of its Tree, will be always of better taÅ¿te than another.

                     <p>The greateÅ¿t part of men at preÅ¿ent are of a hot and dry Complexion; we have all of us the inward parts very hot, through the exceÅ¿s of a burnt Choler, and through the redundancy of a troubled Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

                        </gap>s which we call putrid, which always begin with Å¿hiverings and tremblings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e all the Juices of Fruits being then through the heat of the day, and of the SeaÅ¿on in a conÅ¿iderable motion, they cauÅ¿e in our Stomach Å¿o great a diÅ¿order at the time that the fermentation is there made, that the Chyle becoming crude and undigeÅ¿ted, often gives Birth to great DiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaÅ¿es, whereas the motion of the Juice of Fruits being calm'd by the cold of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of the Night or of the Å¿eaÅ¿on, the Fruits make no diÅ¿order in our Stomach, which then digeÅ¿ts them better, and which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms its Office much better, when it is not interrupted by unuÅ¿ual cauÅ¿es.</p>
                     <p>After all, we ought to know that our Å¿ood being in Å¿ome Å¿ort like our Å¿ubÅ¿tance, changes it Å¿elf eaÅ¿ily within our parts im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptibly to us: Its thus that Bread, FleÅ¿h, an Egg, have no Predominant quality when we put them into our Mouth, and we do not Å¿enÅ¿ibly feel the Vertues when we have them in the Stomach. We muÅ¿t not Å¿ay Å¿o of Aliments which we call medicamental; they nouriÅ¿h little, and on the other Å¿ide they
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:154132:174"/>have Å¿enÅ¿ible qualities, which affect our Tongue and our Palate. We may perceive that a <hi>Vertelongue,</hi> or a <hi>Pear Portail</hi> will cool and moiÅ¿ten our heated Stomach, that it will qualifie the Gall of our Liver, and the heat of our Reins, and that by cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this laÅ¿t part, it will hinder Stones from being form'd there.</p>
                     <p>Finally, its a grand Å¿ecret for our good Health, to keep what we eat, from corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the Stomach. The things of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Nature which we put into it, daily cauÅ¿e diÅ¿orders, whereof our Å¿elves are too often WitneÅ¿Å¿es; if experience did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us of this truth, there would doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿s be a great deal of pleaÅ¿ure in eating many things one after the other; but it Å¿hews us that eating before or after Meals Fruits of a different Nature, that is to Å¿ay, Å¿uch as are eaÅ¿ily corrupted, as Peaches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and Å¿uch as have a more firm Å¿ubÅ¿tance, as Pears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Coction which is made in the Stomach is not laudable, and that it is thence that often proceeds the little Health of thoÅ¿e who over looÅ¿ly indulge themÅ¿elves to the pleaÅ¿ure of the taÅ¿te.</p>
                     <p>If therefore we eat at the end of Meals Peaches and Pears, as it often happens, the Peaches being of a Å¿ubÅ¿tance to be Å¿oon digeÅ¿ted, and to paÅ¿s off quickly, and the Pears of a pretty firm matter, requiring more
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:154132:175"/>time to Concoct, two great inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies follow; the firÅ¿t, that the Peaches trouble the Belly, and make the Food taken at the Meal to deÅ¿cend, without being ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly digeÅ¿ted: the Å¿econd, that they haÅ¿tily drag along with them the Pears, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a longer time for digeÅ¿tion, and thus there comes of it but crudities, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward obÅ¿tructions, which are the cauÅ¿e of Å¿ome troubleÅ¿ome DiÅ¿eaÅ¿e.</p>
                     <p>It is not the Å¿ame when we eat before Meals Mulberries and Peaches, or after Meals Pears and Quinces; the two firÅ¿t Fruits and the two laÅ¿t have a matter and qualities near alike: the former paÅ¿s quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through the Belly by reaÅ¿on of their great humidity: and the later digeÅ¿t themÅ¿elves afterward at leaÅ¿ure, by conÅ¿tringing after the Meal the Å¿uperior Orifice of the Stomach, which by this means acquits it Å¿elf much better of its office.</p>

I Å¿ay much more; experience daily teaches us, that by the moderate uÅ¿e of them we prevent an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of DiÅ¿eaÅ¿es, and that we Cure as many. Our Gardens fail not of Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to relieve us, and I wonder we go Å¿o far into Forrein Countrys to Å¿eek for Drogues, which are muÅ¿ty or rotten, when they are brought to us, Å¿ince we have Å¿o excellent at home.

                        <p>BecauÅ¿e I am oblig'd to follow the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which I have preÅ¿cribed to my Å¿elf, I Å¿hall treat in this Chapter of the good uÅ¿e of thoÅ¿e Fruits which ought to be eaten at Break-faÅ¿t, or before Meals: and I Å¿hall begin with Figgs, which among all Fruits have always been the moÅ¿t eÅ¿teem'd.</p>

                           <p>A Mong all the Food wherewith Men nouriÅ¿h'd themÅ¿elves at the beginning of the World, there is not one which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erves a greater praiÅ¿e than Figgs. The Ancients have made Encomiums on them in many of their Books; and the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians</hi> Å¿o far eÅ¿teem'd them, that they would never go to any FeaÅ¿t where they were not provided in a great plenty. AlÅ¿o Å¿ome have compar'd them to Gold, nay have eÅ¿teem'd them far better than this Mettal. Its doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿s
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:154132:176"/>by reaÅ¿on of their Å¿ugary Å¿weeteÅ¿s, which is the Symbol of peace, that men former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiÅ¿ht their Friends a happy year, by Å¿end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them at the beginning of it Figgs and Honey.</p>
                           <p>In truth, they have admirable Vertues in CaÅ¿e they are eaten with Bread, for Break-faÅ¿t, or before Meals. For it is thus that they qualifie the Bowels, and that they appeaÅ¿e the exceÅ¿s of a troubleÅ¿ome heat. They do not fail of producing other good effects, they quench drought, lenify the BreaÅ¿t, and give a more eaÅ¿y reÅ¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. They clear the Liver and the Spleen of the ObÅ¿tructions wherewith they are afflicted. They diÅ¿charge the Reins and the Bladder of their Å¿lime and Gravel: They looÅ¿en the Belly, be it never Å¿o tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: finally they nouriÅ¿h and fatten both together, witneÅ¿s the famous WraÅ¿tlers, who perform'd moÅ¿t couragiouÅ¿ly, when they liv'd but of Bread and Figgs. Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s alÅ¿o the Keepers of Figg-Gardens, who (according to the Relation of <hi>Galen</hi>) ate in a manner nought but Figgs, and who in the mean while were Å¿o fat, that a man would have Å¿aid that nothing was wanting to them in their way of living.</p>
                           <p>Figgs alÅ¿o have this peculiar to them, that they contribute to the vigour of young People, and to the Health of Å¿uch
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:154132:177"/>as are Old, Å¿o that thoÅ¿e who uÅ¿e of them often, have no Wrinkles in their Face. A better ReaÅ¿on cannot be given than that Figgs, by their fat Å¿ubÅ¿tance engender a Blood which dulcifies much, and this Å¿ame matter being carried to the Å¿uperficies of the Body is there clear'd as well as the Blood of all its Å¿erous and Å¿uperfluous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, Å¿o that what remains Å¿erves as a natural Paint, and renders the Face Å¿mooth, and free from all Å¿orts of Wrinkles.</p>
                           <p>After all, they have the property of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating, CleanÅ¿ing and DigeÅ¿ting; for no man doubts but they are hot in the firÅ¿t degree, and moiÅ¿t in the Å¿econd; the great humidity they have make them Å¿oon cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, and obliges us to eat them with Bread before Meals; for its the Leaven of the Bread which corrects all the ill qualities.</p>
                           <p>Its a Maxim among PhyÅ¿icians, That we ought always to begin with the things that are moiÅ¿teÅ¿t and eaÅ¿ieÅ¿t of digeÅ¿tion, when we Dine, or when we Sup. And this is alÅ¿o another, That after Fruits that are Sweet and LuÅ¿cious, and which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all paÅ¿s quickly through the Belly, we ought rather to Drink pure Water, or Water mixt with a little Wine, than Wine alone. Pure Wine carrys haÅ¿tily into the Lacteal Veins the matter of the Figgs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be digeÅ¿ted, and Å¿o cauÅ¿es winds, and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:154132:177"/>IndigeÅ¿tions in thoÅ¿e who Å¿o do: Whereas Water is the cauÅ¿e of a Å¿lower fermentation, by the means of which the Figgs are perfectly digeÅ¿ted and make afterward a very lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Blood, which eaÅ¿ily becomes our Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tance.</p>
                           <p>They are not proper only for Å¿uch as are in Health, but likewiÅ¿e for thoÅ¿e who have a Fever and are coÅ¿tive, and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagine to my Å¿elf that a Learned PhyÅ¿itian can refuÅ¿e his Patient a Figg half dryed on the Tree by the heat of the Sun.</p>
                           <p>Dry Figgs have much more Vertue than thoÅ¿e which we gather; we may eat of them ev'n after Meals, without offence; alÅ¿o they are more penetrating and hotter than the others through the Å¿ubtilty of their parts, but they are not Å¿o moiÅ¿t. If they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd in the form of a CataplaÅ¿m with Bread and a little Vinegar, haply they are the quickeÅ¿t and moÅ¿t certain remedy for open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an abÅ¿ceÅ¿s, for killing a Carbuncle, or the Å¿welling of the Kings-Evil, or laÅ¿tly to withÅ¿tand the progreÅ¿s of a Latent Cancer.</p>
                           <p>They do much more, if we will believe <hi>DioÅ¿corides,</hi> for they tear from the FleÅ¿h (as we may Å¿ay) a piece of a Bone broken, if we mix them with wild Popy Flowers.</p>
                           <p>The German PhyÅ¿icians have not found a better remedy in the Small-pox, or MeaÅ¿les than the decoction of theÅ¿e Fruits
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:154132:178"/>dry; experience has Å¿hewn them that this decoction, by Purging by Urine, carrys a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all the Malignant Å¿eroÅ¿ity which is the cauÅ¿e of thoÅ¿e troubleÅ¿ome DiÅ¿eaÅ¿es.</p>
                           <p>But among all the good qualities which theÅ¿e Fruits enjoy, there are obÅ¿erv'd Å¿ome ill: they cauÅ¿e Winds which Å¿well the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach; they breed Lice, and makes us fond in careÅ¿Å¿ing Women.</p>
                           <p>The Spirits irritated and Å¿et in motion by the Winds which they engender, and a viÅ¿cous humidity which they cauÅ¿e, are two things which diÅ¿poÅ¿e us to be fond of a Woman, as we have prov'd at larg in a DiÅ¿Å¿ertation we caus'd to be Printed the laÅ¿t year; which has for Title, <hi>Whether thoÅ¿e who Drink Water alone are more amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous than others?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Lice which they Å¿ay Figgs breed in thoÅ¿e who uÅ¿e them in exceÅ¿s, proceed but from the filth of the Skin, and from our excrements which they evacuate by the pores: and the evils they cauÅ¿e in us by the Winds they engender, proceed but from the ill uÅ¿e we make of them; if we eat them with Nuts or Almonds, we Å¿hall correct all the diÅ¿orders they can bring us; and I can aÅ¿Å¿ure you that being Å¿o eaten, they will be without fault, and will do us no hurt, Å¿till provided that we uÅ¿e them with moderation.</p>

                              <hi>ART. II.</hi> Of Nectarins and Peaches.</head>
                           <p>I Cannot bear the contempt Å¿ome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons have for <hi>Nectarins, Alberges, Brug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, Melicotonys, PerÅ¿es</hi> and <hi>Peaches,</hi> nor be Å¿atisfied with the reaÅ¿on they bring for blaming them. They Å¿ay among other things that theÅ¿e Fruits are corrupted Å¿o eaÅ¿ily in the Stomach, that it is almoÅ¿t impoÅ¿Å¿ible to Å¿ecure them from it; that they produce ill Blood, that they cauÅ¿e Fevers; that they injure the inward parts; that the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ians,</hi> from whoÅ¿e Country they were brought, dare not eat of them by reaÅ¿on of their Malignity, and finally that <hi>Galen,</hi> the moÅ¿t knowing of the Greek PhyÅ¿itians, always condemn'd them.</p>
                           <p>But if it were free for me to explain my Å¿elf at large thereon, and to break off the deÅ¿ign which I propos'd to my Å¿elf; I would Å¿hew that the ill uÅ¿e which is made of the moÅ¿t excellent things, is often the cauÅ¿e that they are deÅ¿pis'd and blam'd.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:154132:179"/>Peaches, not to Å¿peak of the other kinds, are a Fruit Å¿o excellent and Å¿o delicious to the taÅ¿te, that I could freely prefer them before Figgs and RaiÅ¿ins, which (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Å¿entiment of Å¿ome) ought to hold the firÅ¿t rank among Fruits.</p>
                           <p>Very far from cauÅ¿ing all the evils where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they are accus'd, they cool the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach when heated, quench the heat of the Liver, allay the burning of the Blood du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the extremity of the Summer heats, and moiÅ¿ten the matter which is then very thick through the drought of the SeaÅ¿on.</p>
                           <p>If we obÅ¿erve well their praecautions, they do not corrupt in the Stomach, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that they are eaten before Meals, and that after having eaten them we drink only Water, if we find a burning in the Bowels; or excellent Wine, if we find our Å¿elves to have a very moderate heat; It is then that they will engender a better Blood than the Herbs we uÅ¿e every day.</p>
                           <p>I own that in <hi>PerÅ¿ia</hi> theÅ¿e Å¿orts of Fruits have Malignant and purgative qualities, but Å¿ince the Trees were tranÅ¿ported into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and have been re-planted in <hi>Italy,</hi> and Å¿ince cultivated in <hi>France,</hi> they have loÅ¿t all the Malignity which they had, and have retain'd but the purgative Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which they have Å¿till, and which they Communicate to their Fruit.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="67" facs="tcp:154132:179"/>Its this purgative Vertue which cauÅ¿es them to be Å¿o much eÅ¿teem'd of by the Healthy and Valetudinarians, who had much rather eat faÅ¿ting four or five excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Peaches, and drink after them Water or Wine, to looÅ¿en the Belly; than to take a doÅ¿e of PhyÅ¿ick, the very name of which raiÅ¿es a horrour in thoÅ¿e that take it the moÅ¿t couragiouÅ¿ly.</p>
                           <p>Its this Å¿ame property which reÅ¿ides in the Leaves, the Flowers and the Fruit of the Peach-tree, which kills the Worms in the Bowels, which Purges Choler and the SeroÅ¿ities of the Body, and Å¿tops ev'n Vomitings at Sea, as we Å¿ee written in the Works of <hi>Julius</hi> of <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>If <hi>Galen</hi> had Liv'd in our days, and had taÅ¿ted Peaches, which the Art and InduÅ¿try of our Gardiners have rendred Å¿o recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, I am certain he would have had quite another opinion of theÅ¿e Å¿orts of Fruit: the Peaches which were carryed to <hi>Rome</hi> in the Time of this PhyÅ¿itian, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Sea from <hi>Sicily</hi> or from about <hi>Naples,</hi> were partly rotted before they came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which made <hi>Galen</hi> at that time to deÅ¿piÅ¿e them, and to condemn them ev'n as a Food very pernicious for Man.</p>
                           <p>Some PerÅ¿ons will correct the ill quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the great humidity of the Peach; by eating it with Bread, by expoÅ¿ing it
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:154132:180"/>two or three days to the Å¿corching heat of the Sun, by eating its Kernel, or finally by drinking pure Wine with it.</p>
                           <p>True it is, experience has taught me, that Bread eaten with Fruits which we ought to uÅ¿e before Meals, corrects their ill qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and that by expoÅ¿ing Peaches to the Sun, they loÅ¿e a Å¿uperfluous humidity which often incommodes us. But the Å¿ame experience has alÅ¿o given me to underÅ¿tand, that Peach and Apricock Kernels much charge the Stomach, and that beÅ¿ides their great bitterneÅ¿s they are alÅ¿o very difficult to digeÅ¿t: that moreover, tho' pure Wine be the Å¿ole thing which oppoÅ¿es it Å¿elf to the coldneÅ¿s, and humidity of this Fruit; nevertheleÅ¿s if we drink much of Å¿uch as is Å¿mall or of a mean Å¿trength, we fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Vomitings and LooÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿es, which Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times degenerate into a Bloody-Flux. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as a little of excellent pure Wine corrects by its noble heat the ill qualities of the Peach: Its haply this experiment which gave occaÅ¿ion for this Latine VerÅ¿e.</p>

                           <p>OF all the Fruits that are eaten there are none but Mulberries which are fit for Men when unripe: theÅ¿e ought only to be Red, drawing toward the Black, to be eaten. If they are throughly ripe, they corrupt Å¿o haÅ¿tily in the Stomach, that Å¿hortly after they cauÅ¿e in thoÅ¿e who eat freely of them, DiÅ¿tempers of the Stomach, LooÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿es, Carbuncles, Malignant Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and often pernicious and Epidemick DiÅ¿eaÅ¿es, eÅ¿pecially if Rains have been rife during the Summer.</p>
                           <p>There is nothing which changes it Å¿elf Å¿ooner into Choler, and which becomes Å¿oon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er poyÅ¿on within our Body than a Black Mulberry. ThoÅ¿e who have the Stomach foul ought to take good heed of eating them, unleÅ¿s they have a mind to be Å¿ick in a Å¿hort time. The Red-blacks withÅ¿tand Corruption more, and tho' they are very moiÅ¿t, they have nevertheleÅ¿s I know not
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:154132:182"/>what of drought through their Å¿harpneÅ¿s and aÅ¿triction, which hinders them from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting Å¿o Å¿oon.</p>
                           <p>To uÅ¿e them well, we ought neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿s to mind the praecautions belonging to them, and never to eat of them but when the Stomach is empty, clean, and hot; for if a heat be not felt in the Bowels, how young and Cholerick Å¿oever a PerÅ¿on be, I do not adviÅ¿e him to eat of them, unleÅ¿s he has a mind to fall into Å¿ome one of the DiÅ¿eaÅ¿es which we have Å¿poken of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                           <p>Mulberries carry their Liquor with them, and nothing ought to be Drank after they are eaten; they excite the appetite, cool the Stomach, appeaÅ¿e drought, allay the heat of the Liver, Purge the Blood of its Å¿uperfluous Å¿eroÅ¿ities, carrying them off by Urine. They blunt the edg of the Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, moiÅ¿ten thoÅ¿e that are troubled with Melancholy and Choler: finally they make the Belly Å¿oluble in thoÅ¿e who are natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly CoÅ¿tive. I will Å¿ay much more, if Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries gather'd from the Tree and eaten in a good plenty can cauÅ¿e the Bloody-flux; as we Å¿ee it every year, nature which moÅ¿t commonly has plac't the remedy in the cauÅ¿e of our evils, has not forgotten to teach us by experience, that theÅ¿e Fruits Å¿erve for an aÅ¿Å¿ured remedy againÅ¿t the invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:154132:182"/>Bloody-flux, if they are given dry to the weight of a Crown in Gold in Red-Wine.</p>
                           <p>Since the chief Vertue of Mulberryes is to cool and to keep the MaÅ¿s of Blood from fermenting, by qualifying the parts which Å¿erve for Å¿anguification, there may be cauÅ¿e to believe that they may be a Remedy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to the Gout as well as all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fruits. For the pain which Gouty Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons feel in the ligaments of their Joints, is caus'd but by a Blood and a Å¿eroÅ¿ity too Å¿harp, which Å¿harpneÅ¿s is blunted by the great humidity of Mulberries, they inÅ¿en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ibly evacuating it by Urine. We need not Å¿eek for other proofs than daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and that which <hi>HegeÅ¿ander</hi> has left us in Writing. He relates that the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry-trees did not bear Fruit for Twenty years together, and that during all that time Men, Women, and Children, were Å¿o trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the Gour, that other cauÅ¿es could not be then diÅ¿cover'd, than the Å¿carcity of theÅ¿e Fruit.</p>

                           <p>SHarp Fruits in general are enemies to Old and Melancholick PerÅ¿ons, when they do not find within themÅ¿elves an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ive heat; they are not edulcorated in their Stomach (if I may Å¿o call it) and are diÅ¿tributed into their Veins without being Concocted and blunted. Which is not done without cauÅ¿ing in the Mouth little Å¿harp belchings, and in the Stomach trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleÅ¿ome prickings, and in the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy an inÅ¿upportable heavyneÅ¿s.</p>
                           <p>It does not happen Å¿o to young Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that are Sanguine and Cholerick who have the Entrals heated: but if caÅ¿ually the Å¿harpneÅ¿s of Cherries with Å¿hort Stems eaten faÅ¿ting, cauÅ¿es Å¿ometimes in theÅ¿e prickings in the Stomach, they need then but to mix Powder Sugar with them, to blunt the point of it.</p>
                           <p>The moÅ¿t refined Sugar and the whiteÅ¿t, which we call Royal, is the leaÅ¿t proper for
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:154132:183"/>the uÅ¿e of Man; it heats and drys us too much, and through the abundance of its Sulphur and Salt, it is entirely oppoÅ¿ite to the principles of our Life: The finer Sugar is the leÅ¿s Å¿weet it is, and the leÅ¿s alÅ¿o it quenches thirÅ¿t. Lime which is a capital Enemy of Man, if it be taken inwardly, or outwardly apply'd, is the chief matter which Refiners make uÅ¿e of, for rendring Sugar whiter and more Å¿olid; and tho' Powder Sugar be made by many repeated Lixivium's, nevertheleÅ¿s it ought always to be preferr'd before Loaf Sugar, and if we will chooÅ¿e the beÅ¿t of all, we muÅ¿t al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways take that which is the whiteÅ¿t among the browns. It is that which is extremely Å¿weet, which quenches thirÅ¿t, which moiÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, and which lenifies the BreaÅ¿t: I thought it proper to make this digreÅ¿Å¿ion for Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons who loveÅ¿weet things, becauÅ¿e Sugar is often Å¿et at our Tables, for rendring our Fruits more agreeable to the taÅ¿te.</p>
                           <p>Sharp Cherryes exhilerate the Stomach, they excite there the Appetite, and appeaÅ¿e the drought. They diÅ¿Å¿ipate the thick hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and by their Å¿harp quality, they cut them (as I may Å¿ay) and divide them, either that they may Å¿erve afterward for Food, or be evacuated with more eaÅ¿e.</p>
                           <p>By all theÅ¿e Vertues they are very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per as well as Mulberries, to oppoÅ¿e the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:154132:184"/>cauÅ¿e and the progreÅ¿s of the Gout, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience Å¿hews us that Gouty PerÅ¿ons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a Å¿enÅ¿ible relief by the uÅ¿e of Fruits, which qualify the Liver, and which cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the Acrimony of the Blood.</p>
                           <p>Moreover they powerfully looÅ¿en the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if they are freely eaten faÅ¿ting while the Dew is yet on the Fruit; and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience teaches us every year that they carry off by a LooÅ¿neÅ¿s long DiÅ¿eaÅ¿es, which all the other Remedies of PhyÅ¿ick have not been able to Cure.</p>
                           <p>The moÅ¿t proper time to eat them is in the Morning faÅ¿ting, either with or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Bread. They have moiÅ¿ture enough to oblige us not to drink any Liquor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them. As for the lateward Cherries which we call at <hi>Rochelle des Guignes</hi> with long Stems, tho' they may be eaten be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Meals; nevertheleÅ¿s I allow them to be eaten after Meals: they have an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able AÅ¿triction, which contributes to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, and which cloÅ¿es the Å¿uperiour O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifice of the Stomach, that it performs its Office afterward much better.</p>
                           <p>The Å¿weet Cherries, eÅ¿pecially thoÅ¿e which we call in this Town <hi>Guindoux</hi> and <hi>Guigneaux,</hi> are much better than the Å¿harp for old PerÅ¿ons and for theÅ¿e who have a nice Stomach; they do not prick Å¿o much the inward parts, and they nouriÅ¿h more.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="77" facs="tcp:154132:184"/>Haply there is not any Remedy more agreeable and more excellent for qualify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Reins, and for clearing thence the Gravel, Slime, and little Stones, than the Wine of Å¿harp Cherries: We muÅ¿t take off them therefore in the Months of <hi>June</hi> or <hi>July,</hi> twelve or fifteen Pounds, we muÅ¿t cleanÅ¿e them of their Stems and Stones, and caÅ¿t them and their Stones broken through the Bung-hole of a Barrel, <hi>(a VeÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿el containing Å¿omewhat more than our Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel)</hi> of good White-wine.

                           </head>
                           <p>NEver has the InduÅ¿try of our Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners appear'd more admirable than in the divers kinds of Pears which we have in <hi>France.</hi> They have taken a particular care to Sow Seeds, and to preÅ¿erve Å¿uch Trees, as in their Wood and Leaves gave them marks of a good hope: For as by Sowing a great many Flower Seeds, there come of all kinds, and ev'n Å¿ome that are beautiful and double, Å¿o by Sowing a great Å¿tore of Pear Kernels, it Å¿eems that Nature pleaÅ¿es her Å¿elf in giving us a grand varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Pear-trees, which produce all new Fruits, and Å¿ome of them delicious to the taÅ¿te: haply it is becauÅ¿e the Pear is the moÅ¿t excellent Fruit of all, that Å¿he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in multiplying its kinds ev'n to an infinite number: It is thus that the <hi>MeÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Jean,</hi> the <hi>Dame Houdote,</hi> or the <hi>Amadote,</hi> the <hi>Gabriel Egand,</hi> the <hi>Micet,</hi> the <hi>Martin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ire,</hi> and a great many other excellent Pears
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:154132:186"/>are come of Kernels, and that they have had the honour to bear the Names of thoÅ¿e who rais'd them.</p>
                           <p>But not to Å¿top at this DiÅ¿courÅ¿e, which Å¿eems to contribute nothing to my deÅ¿ign, I may Å¿ay that the artifice of our Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners has multiplyed for us Pears of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, of Autumn and of Winter; that it has given us more of <hi>CaÅ¿Å¿antes</hi> and of <hi>Burez,</hi> that it has Å¿hewn us more of Sweet, of Å¿harp and of Acerb, and that finally it has procur'd for us more of Vinous, of Ambred and of Musked, than we had before.</p>
                           <p>Among all theÅ¿e Pears the Å¿weet and melting are eÅ¿teem'd the beÅ¿t, they nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿h more than the others which are a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Å¿harp or Acerb, and they are much more friendly to the nature of Man. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleÅ¿s there are Å¿ome who prefer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theÅ¿e firÅ¿t Pears the Sweet and <hi>CaÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                                 </gap>s,</hi> becauÅ¿e theÅ¿e for the moÅ¿t part are odoriferous, and the others are not. They priÅ¿e therefore much more the <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chretien-Pioulier,</hi> or the great <hi>Winter Musk Pear,</hi> than the <hi>Vergoulette,</hi> or the <hi>Bergamot</hi> of Autumn.</p>
                           <p>Be it how it will, the Pear in general cools and moiÅ¿tens the heated Entrals, and by its gentle AÅ¿triction contributes much to the Concoction of the Stomach, by gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly cloÅ¿ing its Å¿uperiour Orifice, and by
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:154132:186"/>LooÅ¿ning a little the Belly; its the reaÅ¿on for which it ought always to be eaten af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Meals, for if it be eaten the Stomach being empty, it cumbers us, and loads us much, and moreover it binds the Belly; but however we eat of it after Meals, it always has very good effects, provided that we have the Stomach diÅ¿pos'd to receive it: for be it that we eat it Crud, or Baked, or RoÅ¿ted, or Boyl'd, with Powder Sugar and Cinnamon, as old People ought to eat it, after all theÅ¿e manners it always Å¿ola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the Stomach drain'd of its Å¿trength and weaken'd by the exceÅ¿s of heat.</p>
                           <p>That which is to be ObÅ¿erv'd in the uÅ¿e of Pears, is, that after Meals we ought to eat fewer Beurees than Caffantes, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer being more digeÅ¿ted, and more ready to corrupt through the leaÅ¿t fault that we commit in our way of living. Moreover we ought always to make choice of the moÅ¿t coloured, and reject thoÅ¿e which we find Worm eaten. Finally we ought after Pears to drink a good Cup of pure Wine, letting this Latin Maxim have its force, <hi>PoÅ¿t Crudum, merum.</hi> But above all we ought to remember not to drink much Wine, nor to drink Å¿uch as is Å¿mall; Å¿mall Wine through its defect of heat not cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing the Pear to be Concocted, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauÅ¿ing crudities by its redundancy,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:154132:187"/>make both of them diÅ¿orders in a Stomach the moÅ¿t ev'n tempered and the moÅ¿t Å¿trong. It is what experience Å¿hew'd us not long Å¿ince in a PerÅ¿on, who fell into inÅ¿upporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pains, having drank much Wine; and <hi>Rodolphus Goclenius</hi> aÅ¿Å¿ures us, that another dyed having drank much Beer, both, after having eaten Pears to an exceÅ¿s.</p>
                           <p>BecauÅ¿e our Stomach is much hotter in Winter than in Summer, our heat not diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ipating it Å¿elf during that firÅ¿t Å¿eaÅ¿on through the pores of our Body, there are PerÅ¿ons who rather eat Pears in Winter than in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and who do not find themÅ¿elves Å¿o much incommoded by them. Haply theÅ¿e Pears have Å¿weated in the heap, and have there Å¿eaÅ¿on'd themÅ¿elves; whereas the Pears of the Summer, having their Sap Å¿till in motion, and having not loÅ¿t their Å¿uperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous humidity, trouble rather the Coction of the Stomach than the Pears of Winter.</p>

                           </head>
                           <p>SInce Apple-trees have been cultivated in the <hi>Pais des BaÅ¿ques,</hi> and in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Normandy,</hi> Men have had a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eÅ¿teem for their Fruits. Trees have been Sown, and afterward Grafted; they have been after that planted and re-planted: Finally they have been Å¿o often chang'd in their Soil, Countrys, and Climats, that the Fruit are become Å¿weet and pleaÅ¿ant.</p>
                           <p>I own that Apples were a long time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pis'd, and that in <hi>Arabia</hi> they have ev'n been accus'd of Contributing to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zick, and to the drying of the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. It has been Å¿aid alÅ¿o that they caus'd weakneÅ¿s in the Joints, and that conÅ¿equent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they increaÅ¿t the Gout and other Flux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, that they engendred Worms in the Bowels, and that finally they caus'd Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigo's, as experience Å¿hews it us, and as it happen'd formerly to <hi>Scipio Gentilis</hi> a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:154132:188"/>Civilian, who after Meals abus'd theÅ¿e Å¿orts of Fruits.</p>
                           <p>But if Men have talkt after this manner, either it has been becauÅ¿e they knew not Apples well, and that they have been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for other Fruit, or they judg'd of them, as Men do of all other things, by the ill Å¿ucceÅ¿s of thoÅ¿e who have abus'd them: for if we will examine the thing very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly, we Å¿hall find that the <hi>Arabians</hi> had none but Apples that were wild, acerb and very unpleaÅ¿ant to the taÅ¿te; that the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s of the Joints, the Worms of the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, and the Vertigo's are caus'd but by the exceÅ¿Å¿es which are committed with them, or by the ill praecautions that are taken in their uÅ¿e.</p>
                           <p>On the contrary, Apples which are Å¿weet and LuÅ¿cious, Odoriferous and firm, exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate the Heart, and allay the exceÅ¿s of its beat; they correct the Gall of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, they dilute the Blood, which is too thick and groÅ¿s: in a word they cool and moiÅ¿ten the heated ViÅ¿cera: Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, whatÅ¿oever is Å¿aid, they oppoÅ¿e the drying of the Body and the PtiÅ¿ick, and we Å¿ee but very few of theÅ¿e Å¿orts of evils where Cyder is common: For this drink is friendly to the Stomach, which it heats in a moderate way; it revives the Heart, and opens the ObÅ¿tructions of the Entrals:
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:154132:188"/>In a word it is of wonderfull uÅ¿e to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick and atrabilarious PerÅ¿ons; that which iÅ¿Å¿ues the firÅ¿t from Apples Å¿quees'd in a PreÅ¿s is not Å¿o excellent as the Å¿econd: and the third reÅ¿embles the <hi>Demy-wine</hi> of our PeaÅ¿ants.</p>
                           <p>If we mix among Apples a little Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Sugar, they make us Å¿pit, and cool our BreaÅ¿t.</p>
                           <p>But they muÅ¿t be us'd with precaution, that is to Å¿ay, that they muÅ¿t be eaten after Meals, becauÅ¿e they are heavy and difficult to digeÅ¿t, that they ought to be forbidden Old People, unleÅ¿s they find themÅ¿elves heated, or that they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd as Pears with Powder Sugar, Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon and Water, and that finally we ought to drink a little of good Pure Wine after having eaten them.</p>
                           <p>In the DiÅ¿tempers which are accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a conÅ¿iderable heat and drought, they give a great relief, if we eat a little of them Crud, or Boyl'd, or that we put of them in Water: and I wonder that in <hi>France</hi> we give our Å¿elves Å¿o much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in Å¿eeking Oranges and Citrons for our: DiÅ¿eaÅ¿es, when we have a <hi>Å¿hort-Å¿tart Apple</hi> or a <hi>SpaniÅ¿h Rennet:</hi> Haply things which coÅ¿t much, and are often difficult to be had, are much better than the common, and that they much more Å¿atisfy the mind of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:154132:189"/>the DiÅ¿eaÅ¿ed; for it is this part which we ought often to Cure in thoÅ¿e who find themÅ¿elves ill.</p>
                           <p>Finally, Apples do not profit us only by taking them at the Mouth, they are a Å¿overeign Remedy for Heart-burnings and for the heats of the Stomach if they are outwardly applied: for if a CataplaÅ¿m be made of Boyl'd Apples, and apply'd hot on the Region of the Heart, or on the pit of the Stomach, haply we may not find an Epithem more Sovereign in thoÅ¿e CaÅ¿es. AlÅ¿o experience has Å¿hewn us that the pulp of a boyl'd Apple put hot on Blood-Å¿hed and inflam'd Eyes, is almoÅ¿t the only Remedy for this evil.</p>

                           <p>ITs a pleaÅ¿ant Medicine to Purge ones Å¿elf by eating after Meals <hi>Portugal Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:</hi> The Fruit which I Å¿o call, are the Quinces whoÅ¿e Grafts were brought from that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and which are almoÅ¿t as pleaÅ¿ant to eat and to behold as a <hi>Bon-Cretien Pear,</hi> at leaÅ¿t they have an odour more Å¿weet and LuÅ¿cious; they are yellow as Gold, and yield in nothing to thoÅ¿e Pears in great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s, Figure and Beauty.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Quinces</hi> are cold and dry, they reÅ¿tringe alÅ¿o manifeÅ¿tly the parts of the Body where they are apply'd; and 'tis by this aÅ¿trin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent quality, that conÅ¿tringing the Stomach in the upper part, and afterward the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teÅ¿tines, after that they are eaten, they Å¿queeÅ¿e, and force out all they meet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their cavity, be it Excrement, Choler or Phlegm. Its what happend to an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> of whom <hi>Galen</hi> Å¿peaks, who was pleaÅ¿antly Purg'd after having
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:154132:190"/>eaten Quinces after a Meal, and having walkt a little upon it: Å¿o that after all the experiments that we have had of them, we ought no longer to doubt of their Vertues.</p>
                           <p>Mean while the Å¿tirring of the Belly which they cauÅ¿e, does not happen but to PerÅ¿ons who have the Stomach weak and nice, and who have need by reaÅ¿on of this to fortifie it; for theÅ¿e Fruits do not work the Å¿ame effects in a young ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buÅ¿t Man; and on the other Å¿ide, if they are eaten before Meals, being very far from moving the Belly, they make it tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and it is Å¿o that thoÅ¿e do who have it ordinarily too moiÅ¿t.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Quinces</hi> have alÅ¿o other excellent Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; if they are eaten Crud, Boyl'd, or preÅ¿erv'd with Sugar, they give an appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, they Å¿top a LooÅ¿neÅ¿s, appeaÅ¿e Vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, withÅ¿tand an old DyÅ¿entery and a Bloody-Flux; and if weÅ¿crape off them Crud, and put the pulp of them hot on the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the Heart in the form of an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theme, when a Malignant Fever attacks us, they contribute not a little toward the Å¿ubduing it<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> Their penetrating and Å¿weet odour revives the Heart and the Brain, and it has not been heard Å¿aid hitherto, that Quinces corrupt in the Stomach.</p>
                           <p>I very much approve the method which
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:154132:190"/>Å¿ome have of making Wine and Water of Quinces. TheÅ¿e two Drinks have near the Å¿ame Vertues, unleÅ¿s it be that the Water is moÅ¿t proper for thoÅ¿e who find themÅ¿elves much heated, and the Wine more meet for thoÅ¿e who do not find a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny praedominant quality, and who are old or Phlegmatick.</p>
                           <p>The Water of Quinces which the Greeks call <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                              </gap>, is made after this manner. We take in the Month of <hi>October</hi> fifty or: Å¿ixty pints of Fountain-Water, of <hi>Paris</hi> MeaÅ¿ure <hi>[which comes near to our Quart]</hi> we put into it ten or twelve Pounds of Portugal Quinces, pared, cleans'd, and cut in Å¿lices; they Å¿teep there till the Water has a yellow colour like that of SpaniÅ¿h Wine; after which we Å¿train this Water, and then let it Å¿eeth ore a gentle Fire till the fourth part be conÅ¿um'd, Å¿cumming it often, and after having put it in a VeÅ¿Å¿el well fill'd and well Å¿topt, we preÅ¿erve it for the Month of <hi>March</hi> following.</p>
                           <p>The Wine is made after this manner; we take at Vintage time Ten or Twelve Pounds of Portugal Quinces, prepar'd after the Å¿ame manner as I have Å¿aid, we throw them into fifty or Å¿ixty pints of good Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret <hi>MuÅ¿t,</hi> and after that they have wrought for thirty days, we Å¿train the Liquor, we put it into another VeÅ¿Å¿el which we Å¿top
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:154132:191"/>up cloÅ¿e, and we preÅ¿erve it for uÅ¿e.</p>
                           <p>TheÅ¿e two Drinks produce good effects in PerÅ¿ons who uÅ¿e of them; they fortify the inward parts, oppoÅ¿e a LooÅ¿neÅ¿s and a DyÅ¿entery, cleanÅ¿e the Reins of their filth, hinder the Vapour of Wine from offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Head, and Å¿ecure us from PeÅ¿tilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Vapours: Finally, they cauÅ¿e Å¿o many good effects, that I muÅ¿t paÅ¿s the bounds of an abÅ¿tract if I would name them all</p>

                           <p>THeÅ¿e Fruits are Å¿eldom at our Tables, and they are eaten moÅ¿t commonly but in a fancy; they are not very agreeable, and there is but little pleaÅ¿ure taken in eating them. Mean while they are not without their uÅ¿e, and contribute Å¿omething to our Health. They are both Å¿o near ally'd in qualities that a PerÅ¿on will not deceive himÅ¿elf if he takes the one for the other. They are cold and dry when they are hard, but when they are Å¿oftiÅ¿h they acquire a better heat, by a Å¿ort of Corruption, that is to Å¿ay, that they are not Å¿o cold; after
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:154132:191"/>the firÅ¿t way they reÅ¿tringe more and nouriÅ¿h leÅ¿s: and they ought to be uÅ¿ed as Quinces, and to be eaten after Meals Å¿oft, Crud, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ted, Boyl'd in Wine with Powder Sugar and Cinnamon, or finally Fryed in freÅ¿h Butter, which does not render them diÅ¿agreeable to the taÅ¿te through the Skill of the Cook.</p>
                           <p>But becauÅ¿e after all theÅ¿e manners they produce the like effects as Quinces, this will oblige me to paÅ¿s in Å¿ilence what I have Å¿aid in the precedent Article: I Å¿hall only add here, that the Stones of Medlars being powdred, and then taken by the Mouth to the weight of a Gold Crown in White-wine, cleanÅ¿e the Reins of their Impurities, and ev'n drive forth Stones which are Å¿mall enough to paÅ¿s through the <hi>
                                 <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>reters,</hi> and afterward through the PaÅ¿Å¿age of the Urine.</p>
                           <p>In reality theÅ¿e Stones are extreamly dry, and they have in their matter particles which powerfully penetrate; for experience has taught me that the Stones of Fruits, and the hardeÅ¿t bones of BeaÅ¿ts and FiÅ¿hes provoke Urine as Å¿pecifick Remedies. I do not doubt but that which <hi>BraÅ¿Å¿avolus</hi> has left us in Writing concerning the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of the Stones of Medlars, is true, Å¿ince he proves it by two Å¿ick PerÅ¿ons who were Cur'd thereby.</p>
                           <p>But we ought not to Å¿uffer our Å¿elves to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:154132:192"/>be abus'd on this account by the promiÅ¿es of <hi>Quacks</hi> and <hi>Mountebanks,</hi> who boaÅ¿t to have certain Remedies for breaking the Stone in the Reins or in the Bladder: I know not whether the Stones of Medlars have more Vertue in <hi>Italy</hi> than in <hi>France,</hi> but at leaÅ¿t I know by experience and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on, that neither the Stones of Medlars, nor all other Remedies have the force to break the Stone, nor to drive it forth of the Bladder, when it is to big too paÅ¿s forth.</p>
                           <p>The chief Vertue of <hi>Services</hi> is to cool and to reÅ¿tringe, as we have Å¿aid: its through theÅ¿e qualities that they Å¿erve for power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Remedies againÅ¿t moiÅ¿t DiÅ¿eaÅ¿es, againÅ¿t inveterate LooÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿es, and againÅ¿t long Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿enteries.

                           <p>THe moÅ¿t excellent RaiÅ¿ins which our Province furniÅ¿hes us with, and which are ordinarily Å¿erv'd at our Table, are thoÅ¿e which are Å¿weet, taÅ¿ting of Sugar and Amber: many prefer them to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fruits; and they yield us a Liquor, which is the moÅ¿t agreeable and richeÅ¿t pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent that ever God gave to Man. If I would extend my Å¿elf here on the Enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium of RaiÅ¿ins, I perÅ¿wade my Å¿elf that I Å¿hould find but too much matter to Å¿ay fine things of them; but, becauÅ¿e I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to my Å¿elf to Write only concerning the uÅ¿e of the Fruits of Trees as briefly as poÅ¿Å¿ible; I muÅ¿t be allow'd to deliver my thoughts in a few words concerning the uÅ¿e of RaiÅ¿ins eaten before or after Meals.</p>
                           <p>But before I explain my Å¿elf thereon, I fancy that I ought to eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h Å¿ome ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Maxims, for well uÅ¿ing them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being damnified thereby.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="95" facs="tcp:154132:193"/>A Woman who has the Stomach nice and weak muÅ¿t never eat RaiÅ¿ins newly gather'd; they puff up the Belly, they cauÅ¿e a rumbling and winds, and trouble the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of the Stomach: moreover Å¿he muÅ¿t not eat but of Å¿uch as are excellent and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ripe, and again Å¿he muÅ¿t not Å¿o much as look on thoÅ¿e which have grown in the Å¿hade, and which the Sun has not heated with its rays.</p>
                           <p>To correct the ill quality of RaiÅ¿ins, they muÅ¿t be gather'd Å¿ome days before you will eat them, or elÅ¿e you may take Å¿uch as have been hung up in a Chamber, or if at time of Vintage you have an inclination for eating Å¿uch as are freÅ¿h, they muÅ¿t be dipt into boyling Water, and then into freÅ¿h Water, and Å¿o they muÅ¿t be Å¿erv'd to Table.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>RaiÅ¿ins</hi> are moiÅ¿t and moderately hot, and by theÅ¿e two qualities they are proportionate to the Principles of our Life; they nouriÅ¿h much more than other Fruits, if we except Figgs: they revive the Spirits by their Å¿weet and odoriferous Å¿avour, they cheer up a Stomach which is languiÅ¿hing and heated through Labour, and moiÅ¿ten the ViÅ¿cera, and Å¿o correct by their pleaÅ¿ant moiÅ¿ture the drought and which the heat of Autumn has there caus'd.</p>
                           <p>Nay there are PhyÅ¿itians who do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them to their Å¿ick Patients when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:154132:194"/>to amend, tho' on condition that they eat them with Bread, and throw away the Stones and the Skin, as two parts which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be digeÅ¿ted by a Stomach how robuÅ¿t Å¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
                           <p>It they are eaten faÅ¿ting, without Bread, as they come from the Tree moiÅ¿tned with the Dew of the Night, they purge the Belly ev'n of thoÅ¿e who have it naturally tardy; there is neither Water of <hi>CaÅ¿Å¿ia</hi> nor <hi>Manna</hi> which ought to be preferr'd to RaiÅ¿ins Å¿o eaten.</p>
                           <p>We ought here to remember not to drink Wine unleÅ¿s it be well diluted, after having eaten RaiÅ¿ins faÅ¿ting: Nay it would be better not to drink at all, or to drink only pure Water; pure Wine mixt in the Stomach with the new Juice of the RaiÅ¿ins makes Å¿o extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary a fermentation, that the accidents which ariÅ¿e from it are much greater than you may imagin: For the Wine carrys the Chyle and the Juices into the Bowels and into the Reins, before they are digeÅ¿ted, and Å¿o cauÅ¿es impurities and indigeÅ¿tions in the Blood; whereas Water hindring the great ebullition of the Stomach, contributes to a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction; it cauÅ¿es the Chyle to become more pure, and that we are more refreÅ¿ht and moiÅ¿tn'd by the uÅ¿e of the RaiÅ¿ins.</p>
                           <p>We ought not Å¿o to do when we eat them after Meals, for we may drink a good GlaÅ¿s
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:154132:194"/>of pure Wine, and not conÅ¿ider Å¿o much the RaiÅ¿ins prepar'd as we have Å¿aid before, as the food which we have taken at our Meal.</p>
                           <p>Tho the Stones cannot be digeÅ¿ted, yet we ought not to throw them away when we eat RaiÅ¿ins after Meals: For Å¿ince they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tringent, they correct the great humidity, which is the cauÅ¿e of the evils which they bring upon us. We muÅ¿t chew them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore very Å¿mall, and reduce them to minute parts betwixt the Teeth, that they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the Coction of our Stomach, and correct the ill qualities of the RaiÅ¿ins: It is thus we ought to eat after Meals the dry RaiÅ¿ins which are brought from <hi>Spain;</hi> for by nouriÅ¿hing and lenifying our inward parts they Å¿olace them by their Å¿weetneÅ¿s, and fortifie them by the aÅ¿triction of their Stones.</p>
                           <p>I Å¿hall not paÅ¿s by here the excellent drink. which is made with dry RaiÅ¿ins, and is call'd <hi>de Cabat.</hi> The Stones muÅ¿t be taken away from fifteen or twenty Pounds, and then the RaiÅ¿ins muÅ¿t be bruis'd a little: and in the Month of <hi>January</hi> or of <hi>February,</hi> which is the time that they are brought to us from <hi>Spain,</hi> they muÅ¿t be put in an excellent Barique <hi>(a VeÅ¿Å¿el Å¿omewhat more than our Barrel)</hi> of White-wine to drink at <hi>EaÅ¿ter.</hi> This Wine will have the colour of a SpaniÅ¿h Wine, it will be pleaÅ¿ing to the Palat, and will have qualities not to be contemn'd; for it leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies

                           <p>ThoÅ¿e which are brought us ordinarily from <hi>Portugal</hi> are Å¿harp or <hi>aigres-douces,</hi> they are colder than the former, and they refreÅ¿h

                           <p>WE cultivate in our Gardens Å¿weet, <hi>Aigres-doux,</hi> and Å¿harp Pomegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate-trees which came to us from <hi>Spain;</hi> for as for thoÅ¿e of <hi>France</hi> which are wild, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eat the Fruits: The Flowers and Rinds of Pomegranates are aÅ¿tringent, and both Å¿erve to Cure our DiÅ¿eaÅ¿es which are caus'd through a too great humidity. They have the Vertue of conÅ¿tringing the parts of our Body together, and of giving them the Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation which they had loÅ¿t: The inÅ¿ide of the Kernels of a Pomegranate is uÅ¿eleÅ¿s and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeÅ¿ted, our Stomach cannot diÅ¿Å¿olve it, and there is no Body who eats it. There is but the pulp which is about the Kernels that yields an agreeable Juice, wherewith we are often Å¿olac'd in our Å¿ickneÅ¿Å¿es.</p>
                           <p>Sharp Pomegranates ought to be us'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:154132:196"/>Meals, when the Stomach is empty; and if the point of their Å¿harpneÅ¿s does us hurt, as it happens in thoÅ¿e who have this part weak and tender, we need but blunt it with Water and Sugar to make a delicious Drink: Then this agreeable Liquor cools the Stomach, quenches thirÅ¿t, qualifies the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, weakens the Å¿harpneÅ¿s of the Choler, revives the Heart, reÅ¿iÅ¿ts putrefaction, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes Urine; in a word, its a Drink proper for the Sick and Å¿ound. It is much better than the <hi>BoÃ¼illons</hi> of Veal, and of cooling Herbs, which are taken too often in the Summer, and in Autumn to qualify the Entrals, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iÅ¿t the heat and drought of the SeaÅ¿on: for the continual uÅ¿e which is made of <hi>BoÃ¼illons,</hi> is wholly an enemy to the Stomach, their Å¿ubÅ¿tance relaxes too much the membranes, and to perform well its Office it muÅ¿t have a certain temperament which is not too moiÅ¿t; whereas the Drink of Å¿harp Pomegranates, by reÅ¿tringing it gently, tempers this part, and at the Å¿ame time all the others.</p>
                           <p>Sweet and vinous Pomegranates do not cool Å¿o much as the Å¿harp, but they dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify more, and are more proper for Old and atribilarious PerÅ¿ons.</p>
                           <p>ThoÅ¿e who find a heat in their Bowels, are very much Å¿olac'd after having Å¿wallowed Å¿ome Spoonfulls of the Juice of theÅ¿e Fruits: It is Å¿o that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> us'd of them,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:154132:197"/>from whoÅ¿e Country Pomegranates were brought: and it were thoÅ¿e alÅ¿o who taught us by their own experience the greateÅ¿t part of the good effects which they cauÅ¿e in us, when we uÅ¿e of them. It cannot be Å¿aid what goods the Juice of Å¿weet and vinous Pomegranates, preÅ¿s'd forth, Å¿cumm'd, and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented may produce: it Å¿trongly oppoÅ¿es all inward Fluxions, it reÅ¿iÅ¿ts all Fevers which are accompanied with a LooÅ¿neÅ¿s and an exhauÅ¿ting of our Å¿trength, and it has this proper to it, that it fortifies all our languiÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parts. If we will make Å¿ome Bottles of it, we muÅ¿t Å¿queeze forth in a PreÅ¿s a Å¿uffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent quantity of Pomegranates, we muÅ¿t Å¿eeth the Juice over a gentle Charcoal Fire to the diminution of the third part, after having well Å¿cumm'd it, and afterward it muÅ¿t be kept for uÅ¿e.</p>
                           <p>If we put in White-wine the Kernels of Å¿weet or vinous Pomegranates, or after the Å¿ame manner as we have preÅ¿crib'd for Å¿harp Cherries, we Å¿hall have a Wine which will yield in nothing to all the Remedies which PhyÅ¿ick has invented hitherto for allaying the burning of the Reins, for cleanÅ¿ing forth all the filth, and for hindring Stones from being there form'd.</p>

                           <p>THe Red Corands and the White, which we call <hi>Gadelles,</hi> have very near the Å¿ame qualities, tho' the <hi>Gadelles</hi> are more Å¿harp, and the Red more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ant to eat. Both of them cool and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tring the parts of the Body through which they paÅ¿s; they hinder Vomiting, quench drought, blunt the Choler, remove Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tructions, fortify the parts, and they Å¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace both the healthy and Sick that are heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if they are us'd before or after Meals.</p>
                           <p>Their pungent Å¿harpneÅ¿s ought to be corrected, as that of Cherries and Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granates, or we may make them into a Sugar PaÅ¿te or Gelly, which is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for thoÅ¿e who have the Stomach weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end by long SickneÅ¿Å¿es; and I have Cur'd many PerÅ¿ons of conÅ¿iderable quality, who had this part very much afflicted by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Vomitings, and had a troubleÅ¿ome LooÅ¿neÅ¿s of the Belly, by giving only a
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:154132:198"/>PaÅ¿te or Gelly of Corands, and of the moiÅ¿t conÅ¿erve of Provins RoÅ¿es.</p>
                           <p>In Imitation of the <hi>Turks,</hi> during the great heats of the Summer, we may make of the greateÅ¿t part of the Fruits before Å¿poken of, a Å¿ort of <hi>Sherbet</hi> to be drank with Ice: and I allow young Sanguine and bilous People, who have known by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience that drinking with Ice does not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commode them, I allow them, I Å¿ay, to drink of it, with prudence for allaying the exceÅ¿s of their heat: This will be a Å¿ure means to hinder them from being Å¿et upon by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual and Malignant Fevers, and to keep them in good Health during all the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and Autumn. As for others who are of another temperament, and of another Age, they muÅ¿t not touch of it, and they muÅ¿t remember that heat, which we muÅ¿t not deÅ¿troy, is one of the Principles of our Life.</p>
