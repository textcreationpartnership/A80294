            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:154132:3"/>thereof; I found in many of them very wild Notions and idle Chimera's, yet the late Authors, (as Mr <hi>Evelin, Auſten, Ray, Cotton, Meagar, Worlidge,</hi> with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and above all, the ingenious Mr <hi>Langford</hi>) Treat very excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently of moſt parts thereof, yet no one to touch every point, but in many things very defective: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I thought ſome idle hours not ill ſpent, if out of them all, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the beſt of my judgment, I cull'd ſuch Rules and Obſervations, as with the addition of my one Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, a more compendious and compleat Work thereof might be Compiled, which would ſave the Planter much Expence and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in buying, and reading ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as have thereon writ; the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merouſneſs of Authors rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming, than advancing any Stock of knowlidge, by leading their <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> into ſo many Various and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth Paths, as at length to loſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a Meander of confuſion and contrarieties; for that, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:154132:3"/>end therefore is this Collection made; and herein I have imitated the Painter, that deſigning the Pict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure of <hi>Venus,</hi> ſummon'd together all the fair Ladies of the Town, and from one he Selected an Eye, another a Noſe, and from a third a Lip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that whatſoever he found commendable in any one, he reduced the ſame into his Draught, and thereby made a perfect Picture of a moſt exquiſite Beauty: In like manner have choſen out (but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the ſame ſucceſs lies in the determination of the Judicious) whatſoever I found either uſeful, neceſſary, or conducible to this Art, for the Planter to know, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſeparated the beſt Metal from all droſs, and impurities, and out of every one extracted the Quinteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, by reducing the ſame into the method you here ſee; which to thoſe whoſe Genius leads them to the Propagation, ordering, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagery of Fruit-trees, making of Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and Engliſh Wines, may be acceptable, and of ſomthing more
<pb facs="tcp:154132:4"/>than ordinary eſteem; by reaſon they now need not tumble over and rake in a multitude of Authors, for that which at one entire View they may clearly ſee, and all that is any ways requiſite to be underſtood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that Subject, as alſo all Impertinencies, Legendary ſtories, unpracticable, and improbable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects thereabouts utterly rejected, which are the grand impediments and diſcouragments of this beneficial Art.</p>
                  <p>How not only eaſy and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but profitable the Planting of Fruit-trees is, will be needleſs to make a diſcourſe on, ſince not only Thouſands of People, but whole Counties can infallibly evidence by their daily experience the many and vaſt advantages thereof. Only our Saturnine Northern People are not very inclinable thereunto, out of a certain conceited and inbred hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, of not doing any thing their Anceſtours have not cared for, which makes them tenaciouſly adhere to
<pb facs="tcp:154132:4"/>their old and accuſtomed ways of Culture, and neglect, and almoſt ſcoffingly deride any improvement their fore-Fathers did not underſtand, or uſe; this humour too, is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing augmented, upon a Whim they have, that their Soil is ſo Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>il and improlifical by the coldneſs of their ſituation, that it would be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour loſt to go about it; all which are idle fancies, ſince experience ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently teſtifies, that moſt ſorts of Apples, Pears, Cherries, and Plums with due Cultivation proſper very well in each part of our Climate, unleſs it be amongſt the meer Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineers; ſo that would our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen but exile ſloth and careleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they may have as flouriſhing Orchards as others; the Soil and Air being propitious enough for that purpoſe. I have known ſome ſo negligent, that altho they have had Fruit-trees given them, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſet made a very hopeful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in their growth and bearing, had not their wretched Lazineſs permitted them to be ſpoil'd by Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

Fine: chooſe not a wet or very ſtiff Clay Land, nor over-rich with Dung, but ſuch as being it ſelf good, you may make better only with a little mixture of very rotten Dung: Let it be fenced from the cold as well as you can, ſo that it be free from ſhade and droppings of Trees.</p>

                        <note place="margin">How to ſet Stones for Stocks.</note>§. 2. When you ſet Stones, (which if they be Stones of Fruit ſoon ripe, you muſt
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:154132:10"/>keep in Sand till <hi>October</hi>) do it by a Line, pricking holes about ſix Inches diſtance one from another, and then put in the Stones about two Inches deep, with the ſharp end uppermoſt: When one Row is finiſhed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move your Line a Foot farther, and ſet an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Row in the ſame manner; but let your third Row be about a Yard diſtant from the ſecond, that you may have liberty to go between every two Rows to Weed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſet your Plum-ſtones and Cherry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones each apart by themſelves, and ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to ſet as many as you have a mind. Poſſibly ſome of theſe Stones may not come up till the ſecond <hi>Spring</hi> after ſetting, and may not fruſtrate your deſire, if you then expect them. Some keep their Stones in Sand or Earth, in Tubs (well cover'd for fear of Mice) placed in a dry Cellar, in a Houſe, and then in <hi>February</hi> they Sow them (having prepared their ground) in Trench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, as Peaſe are Sown. The Stones of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricocks and Peaches are apt to ſpring too forward, if ſet too ſoon, and be nipt by Froſts. In like manner you may ſet Stones of Sloes, Haws, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

After the ſame manner you are to ſet all kind of Nuts, Acorns, Aſh-keys, or the Seeds or Kernels of any other kinds of Shrubs or Trees; but becauſe it's neceſſary that your young Wallnut-Trees and Cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut-trees ſhould grow longer in your Seed-plot

                     <p>When either you or any Neighbour hath made Cyder, Verjuice or Perry, take the Muſt, Murc, (or as ſome call it the Pouz) which is the ſubſtance of the fruit after the Juice is preſſed out, the ſame day or the next day after, before it heats, and with a Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle ſift out the Seeds on a clean Floor, or Cloth, and theſe you muſt ſow (as ſoon as you can conveniently) upon Beds of very fine Earth, very thick; for ſome being brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the grinding or pounding the fruit, and others not being ripe, may never come up; then ſift Mold upon them, about two Fingers breadth in thickneſs. This way is much better than to Sow the Seeds with the Muſt, Murc, or Pouz together, (as ſome do) becauſe the Muſt will heat them, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Seeds will putrifie, and others will not be able to root or ſhoot up, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſo impriſon'd in that dry and tough ſtuff, clinging about them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="4" facs="tcp:154132:11"/>The Beds of Earth you ſow them on may be made about two Foot in breadth, with a good diſtance between the Beds, that you may the better come to Weed them, and draw them up as you have occaſion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">How to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice.</note>§. 5. To keep Fowls or Birds from ſcra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping them up, lay ſome white Thorn on the Beds till the Ground be well ſetled.</p>
                     <p>Some cover the Beds with Fern or Straw, to keep them warm in the <hi>Winter,</hi> which may not do amiſs, but then it muſt be taken off at the Springs approach.</p>
                     <p>If Moles or Mice get in (which you may eaſily diſcover, becauſe the Mice leave ſhells of the Seeds on the top of the Beds) they muſt be deſtroyed.</p>
                     <p>For Mice, lay Poiſon, or Oatmeal mixt with Glaſs pounded ſmall, and Butter, and caſt bits of it upon the Beds, or ſet Traps for Moles or Mice, better known than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</p>
                     <p>The next Spring you will ſee theſe Stones and Seeds come up plentifully; firſt the Leaves, almoſt of the ſhape of the Kernel ſplit in two, and from betwixt them will the Stem Put forth. Keep them clean from the Weeds all the year, which muſt be plucked up while they are young, leſt if they get Root, in drawing them up, you root up the Seedlings with them; but if in the Weeding any Seedlings come up, ſet them again almoſt to the top; then water them.</p>

                        <pb n="5" facs="tcp:154132:11"/>Theſe Weeds, and ſuch as are pluckt up any where elſe, thrown up into a heap, will rot, eſpecially if any Lime be ſcatter'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, and become very good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure; but this ſhould be before they are Seeded, for then the Manure made of them will be apt to make the ground it is caſt upon more ſubject to Weeds.</p>
                     <p>If a dry time happen, you may ſome time in the Summer water the Beds.</p>

                     <p>Peach-ſtones are to yeild Stocks for Peach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and Nectarines.</p>
                     <p>Stones of the Wheat-Plum (which is a Plum ripe in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and is white) or of the white Pear-Plum, or of ſome other good white Plum (in defect of them) whoſe Tree puts forth large Shoots, Branches,<note place="margin">Stones of the white Pear-plum or Wheat-plum make the beſt ſtocks for Peaches, Nectarines and Apri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks to be inoculated on.</note> and Leaves, or for want of them, Stones of the Muſtle-Plum, black Pear-Plum, Primordian, or any other black or red Plum, whoſe Tree is of free growth, and large leaved, will yeild you excellent Stocks for Peaches, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctarines, Apricocks, and Plums; but ſtocks raiſed from the ſtones of Damſons are the worſt, and very bad, being dry ſtocks, and not ſo ſappy as the before-mentioned.</p>
                     <p>The Seeds of Pears yield the beſt ſtocks for Pear-trees.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="6" facs="tcp:154132:12"/>Grafting Pear-Grafts or Cyens on a white Thorn or Quince ſtock, will make the Tree to be of ſmall growth, and the Fruit bad, having hard and ſtony Cores, if grafted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Thorn Tree.</p>
                     <p>Black Cherry ſtones and Red Cherry ſtones yield ſtocks to Graft or Inoculate Cherries on; but the Black Cherry ſtocks are beſt; for they yield goodly ſtraight large Plants, and full of Sap, and become greater Trees than thoſe produced of Red Cherry ſtones, and conſequently more proper for Orchards and Fields.</p>
                     <p>To Inoculate an Apricock very low on a white Pear-Plum ſtock, or on a Wheat-Plum-ſtock, and then after a Years growth Inoculate a Peach or a Nectarine on it, is highly approved; only this way there will be two Years loſs of time: And note that the red Roman Nectarine will ſcarce take on a Plum-ſtock any other way.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Stocks rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of Crab kernels are better than thoſe raiſed of Apple kernels.</note>The Seeds or Kernels of Crabs and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples yeild ſtocks the moſt proper to Graft any kind of Apple upon, and though the ſtocks raiſed of Apple-ſeeds or Kernels do ſhoot more clear and ſmooth, and come for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward faſter, and are of a quicker and lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger growth in ſtock than ſtocks raiſed of Crab-kernels or Seeds, and Grafts grafted on them will grow quicker than on Crab-ſtocks, yet by the univerſal conſent and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of all, ſtocks raiſed from the Seeds or Kernels of Crabs are preferred either for
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:154132:12"/>Orchards or Fields, Cyder, Baking, or Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, far before ſtocks raiſed of Seeds or Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels of Apples, and that for theſe reaſons: Crab-ſtocks are more free from Canker, and more hardy, and ſo better able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure cold and courſe Land, and becauſe they root better, and ſo will make large Trees, and will make Buds, Bloſſoms, and Fruit more hardy and ſtrong to endure froſt and cold weather in the Spring: it alſo not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lp preſerves, but quickens, enlivens, makes brisk and poignant the Guſt of any deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Apple.</p>
                     <p>But if you intend to propagate any deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Apple which is over tart in taſte, Graft it on ſome ſtock raiſed of the Gennet Moyl, or ſome ſweet Apple Tree, which will ſweeten its juice ſomething. So a Pear is improved by Grafting on a Quince-ſtock, but the Tree will not be large, but ſerve well for a Dwarf-Tree.</p>
                     <p>However where you cannot conveniently be ſtored with Crab-kernels, Apple-ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels are not ſo much inferiour to them, but they may well enough be made uſe of (as they commonly are) for raiſing ſtocks to Graft Apples upon.</p>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:154132:13"/>have been cut down, and Sprung up again, out of the remaining ſtump, or otherwiſe hurt, which though not eaſily diſcern'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe skin'd over, yet will be a prejudice to them for ever; alſo many of the ſtocks ſo got out of Woods and Hedges, have, for want of room, and by reaſon of ſhades and the dropping of other Trees about them, been checkt and baffl'd in their growth, and ſo become crooked, ſcabby, ill grown, rough, and unkindly, and never like to make good and thriving Trees. Some that furniſh themſelves this way with ſtocks, chooſe ſuch as are largeſt, and thoſe having for the moſt part, thick and hard Bark, and old Roots, which come on but ſlowly when they are removed to make Apple-Trees. Likewiſe if theſe ſtocks be not Grafted ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry low, (and if they are, a Years growth or two will be loſt) they will put forth Branches and Suckers of their own every Year, in ſuch abundance, that without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant pruning of them, the Grafts will be in danger of being ſtarved, and a better advantage may be made of Crab-trees in Hedg-rows and rough Grounds, by graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them where they are, where they will thrive the better.</p>
                     <p>The only objection is, that a Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be furniſhed with Trees of a good large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to bear ſo ſoon by ſtocks raiſed by Kernels and Stones as thoſe got out of Woods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or thoſe raiſed by Suckers,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:154132:13"/>that may be of ſeveral Years growth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore uſed.</p>
                     <p>To which it's anſwered and approved by daily experience, That if at the ſame time that you get Crab-tree ſtocks (of ſix or ſeven Years growth) out of the Wood or Hedges, or Suckers, and ſet them in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be grafted, you ſow Kernels or Stones, the Stocks and Suckers you ſo graft for ſix or eight years may continue larger and big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than Trees that come of Kernels and Stones, but yet theſe leſſer Trees ſhall ſo get ground of the other, that by the tenth or twelfth year they ſhall not only overtake them, but out-ſtrip them in growth.</p>

When the Seed-plants or Seedlings are drawn up, cut off the ſide-ſprigs from about the top, and the ſtrings from about the Roots, and ſnip off the ends or extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities both of the top, that it may not run too faſt upwards, but the Body may grow in bigneſs, and of the Tap or Heart-Root, that it may not run directly downwards, (leſt it run farther than the good Soil) but may be more apt to ſpread its Roots in breadth, and near the top of the Ground, where the beſt Soil is.</p>
                     <p>Then have Beds prepared of good fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til dry Earth, not over-rich, leſt upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval afterward into a much worſe Soil, (as for the moſt part Orchard and Field-ground is) your Trees coming of a ſudden from ſuch delicate Food to ſuch courſe Fare, pine away, if they do not periſh. And this is rationally thought to be the cauſe why many Trees bought out of <hi>London</hi>-Nurſeries (which are vaſtly deep with fat
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:154132:15"/>and rich Manure) decay, or come on very poorly when they are brought into the Country.</p>
                     <p>Therefore upon every removal or tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting, either of Seed-plants, or young Trees, endeavour to have Earth as good, or better (to place next the Roots at leaſt) than that out of which they were taken.</p>
                     <p>If any of theſe ſpring upright, top them early, (that is, cut off about an Inch long at a Bud at the uppermoſt end of the Seed-plant, that the cut may be covered with a freſh ſprig) and it will make them grow bigger Bodied, and ſpread at the cut place, and ſo become ſooner ready for Graſting. And let not the Roots be too long; about a handful in length (or leſs) is ſufficient; for if the Roots be long, and ſet deep, the Trees afterwards are taken up with more difficulty, and worſe Roots. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why all Seed-plants ought to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted or removed after one Summers growth on the Seed-bed, is, becauſe they get good Roots, which of themſelves thruſt down one ſingle Root for the moſt part, and that into the bad Soil. But if you would have ſtocks an Ell or more high, to Graft or Inoculate for Standerds, you muſt not top them, or cut off their Tops; becauſe top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping them makes them to ſpread at the cut place, and their growing up to ceaſe.</p>

And this inconvenience is always found in Trees coming of Seed, and not grafted or inoculated, That they are very long before they bear Fruit, whereas ſtocks grafted or inoculated from Trees, which experience aſſures are of good bearing kinds, and Fruits, commonly bear well in three or four years, and ſo continue.

                        <note place="margin">Meer grafting betters not Fruit.</note>§. 12. Mere Grafting doth not meliorate the Fruit at all; as if you graft a Cyen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame Tree you took it from, the Fruit will be the very ſame, without the leaſt alteration from what the Tree bore before it was ſo grafted; but Fruit may ſomething participate of the nature of the Stock where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it's grafted, ſo as to be made by it either better or worſe; as if you graft a very ſour Apple Cyen upon a ſweet Apple Tree, the Fruit will be ſomething better: So a ſweet Apple Cyen, grafted on a very harſh four Crab-ſtock, hath produced a better Fruit than the Tree from whence the Apple-graft was had. So a Pear-Cyen, grafted on a Quince-ſtock, hath mended the Pear; and though the Graft doth keep its own Nature, and mightily predominate on what Stock ſoever it's grafted, yet ſuch an union as that of the Stock and the Graft, in natural Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, is hardly conceivable without ſome commixture of their Natures, and there are ſome reaſons from experience which make this more than probable, as</p>
                     <p n="1">I. The Seeds of a grafted Tree take much after the ſtock, and it's ſomething ſtrange to conceive the Kernel ſhould participate

                     <p n="2">II. Thoſe that produce the beſt Fruit by their ſtones or ſeeds, yet vary from the Fruit the ſeed or ſtones were taken out of, which in all likelihood proceeds from the mixture of the quality of the ſtock and Cyen in that Tree the ſtone came from.</p>

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:154132:22"/>are grown too big for the Knife; a good ſtrong Pruning-Knife, made a very little coming, which will be ready to cut off the heads of your ſmaller ſtocks you intend to graft: alſo a good midling Knife to cleave ſome of the ſmaller ſort of ſtocks with; alſo an Inſtrument like a broad Chiſel, the handle of Iron, and the edge alike on both ſides, not ſloping on one ſide, like that of Joyners, but plain as a Knife, and very thin, about three or four Inches in breadth; with which you may either cleave your larger ſtocks, or prune your Trees; alſo a little Mallet, or elſe a ſtick about a Foot long, made of an old Spade or Shovels handle, or ſome other hard wood, to uſe inſtead of a Mallet, to drive your Knife when you cleave the ſtock: Alſo an Iron Tool about ſix Inches in length, made turning at each end about an Inch and an half; if it be ſteeled at either end, it will be the better, and not ſo apt to bend when you open a ſtrong ſtock: theſe ends are to be made flat, a little like a Chiſel, but not above half an Inch broad at moſt, only pretty ſtrong; if yon will, one end may be pretty ſmall for the ſmaller ſtocks, and the other bigger; the uſe of it is to ſupply the place of a Wedge, by holding open your Stock till you have ſet your Graft or Cyen exactly in its place in the Cleft of the Stock.</p>

Theſe Cyens or Grafts you get ought to be the laſt years Shoots, ſtrong and very well grown, that grow on the top or out-ſide of a Tree, that ſeveral years expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of thoſe that know it, can faithfully aſſure you bears very well, and good fruit of its kind; and cut not off the tops of the Cyens until that you graft them, for ſo they will keep better; but immediately after grafting, the tops of Grafts are to be cut at a Bud, that they may ſpread the better, and of ſuch as are but ſhort, if there be Bloſſom-buds on the top, as it's commonly ſeen in Pearmain-Cyens, and many other good bearing kinds. Grafts that are very ſmall and ſlender commonly fail, therefore chooſe the faireſt, fulleſt, and ſtrongeſt ſhoot of the laſt years growth, and fulleſt of Buds, and of good bearing kinds, elſe you may have fair Trees, and little or no Fruit on them, and ſo fancy you have an Orchard, though ſeldom Fruit; for ſome Trees will
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:154132:23"/>grow and bloſſom very well, yet rarely bear Fruits; the reaſon is, for that they were grafted from bad bearing Trees, and are of bad bearing kinds.</p>
                     <p>A ſhoot or Branch of the year next fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going makes the beſt Cyens or Graft, and thrives beſt, though in <hi>Herefordſhire,</hi> when they graft old Trees, they commend and uſe Cyens of two or three years growth, yet thoſe are ſeldom found to have convenient Buds to put forth at, and often times have bloſſoming Buds on them, and make not ſo good a growth, neither have they ſo good a joint to graft at as thoſe of the laſt year.</p>
                     <p>When you get Grafts, you had beſt cut off at leaſt three Inches of that which grew the year before with them, beſides the laſt years Shoot, for ſo they will keep the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and you may uſe about an Inch and an half of that old Wood in every Cyens when you Graft it.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps you may not have ſeveral ſorts of Plums, Cherries, or Pears ſo near you, as that you may get Buds freſh enough for Inoculation: In this caſe you may procure Cyens, and graft them, and they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue freſh, though you ſhould ſend for them from beyond Sea.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Cyens or Grafts of any kind may be grafted immediately after they are got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and that ſucceſsfully; or they may be kept three Weeks or a Month before they are uſed, and there ought to be a Fortnight
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:154132:24"/>or three Weeks betwixt the time of their being cut, and their being grafted, that the Stocks in that time may be repleniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Sap, and the Cyens more empty of it; and then they will quicker incorporate by more greedily attracting the Sap out of the Stock.</p>
                     <p>To keep your Cyens or Grafts after they are cut, you need not, as ſome direct, bury them in moiſt Mold; for this may be a means to make them ſwell and bud forth by receiving moiſture from the Earth; and then when by grafting they are expoſed to the cold open Air, they will be in danger to wither and die before they have nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Stock. You may lay them in a dry houſe, ſo it be near no heat, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſhade of an old Tree or Hedge, and cover them all over with dry Mold, that the Air may not have too much Influence upon them: though they ſeem ſomewhat dry, yet if they cut with a freſh colour, and be not much withered, they will not grow the worſe, but rather the better; yea ſome that have ſeemed withered, being carried 70 or 80 Miles, have grown well. And they may be carried hundreds of Miles in a Box of Mold, or their ends ſtuck in Clay, or a Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nip, and wrapped about with green freſh Moſs, that they bruiſe not; bind not many together; for if ſo, thoſe in the middle will dry, and be ſpoiled in certain days, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lay them thin in the Mold.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="31" facs="tcp:154132:24"/>Be very careful that the Buds be neither hurt or rub'd in the binding or carriage of the ſaid Grafts.</p>
                     <p>In providing Cyens or Grafts of Pears, Plums, and Cherries, you muſt cut them in the beginning of <hi>February,</hi> having reſpect to the forwardneſs or backwardneſs of the Spring, and the warmth or coldneſs of the Country you live in; but you muſt be ſure to cut them before the Buds have any ſpeck of white appear on them.</p>

                     <p>Grafts of Cherry and Plum-Trees muſt be grafted ſooneſt, becauſe they bud earli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and you are to begin with them ere they bud forth, then with Pear-trees, and laſtly with Apple-trees.</p>
                     <p>Elect the faireſt and largeſt Grafts on the top Branches of a Tree, and of the laſt years growth, and on the Sun-ſide of the Tree, which will bear ſooner than thoſe got on ſide-branches.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Of joints and height of grafting</note>§. 4. There be ſome indifferent whether they graft at a joint or no, but forecaſt to have a Bud directly behind the ſhoulder of the Cyen; if Cyens with joints were ſcarce, you might practice ſo on ſmall Stocks, that will ſpeedily be cover'd, but if Cyens can be had with joints, never graft with others, for theſe will cover the Stocks ſooner. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:154132:25"/>this is the opinion of many, yet I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways grafted at one of the loweſt Buds on the thicker end of the laſt years Shoot or Sprout, and valued not a joint of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer years growth, unleſs the Graft were too ſhort; for the ſtraiter and ſmoother your Graft is, the more exactly you may fit it to your Stock, eſpecially if your Stock be young, and have but a thin Sap, and this was very ſucceſsful; however grafting at a joint may do well if the Stock have a thick Sap or Bark, as commonly your Wood-ſtocks and all large Trees have. The wood below the knot or ſeam is commonly crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and not ſo ſmooth and ſtraight as the wood below a Bud on the thicker end of the laſt years Shoot; therefore rather graft at a Bud, becauſe you may joyn the Graft and Stock the more exactly.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Height to graft at.</note>§. 5. If you Graft Apple or Pear-Cyens, graft a Foot or leſs from the ground; do the like for Wall-trees and Dwarf-trees, but if you graft Cherry or Plum-Cyens, for ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dards in Orchards or Fields, graft them ſix or ſeven Foot high, and at that height let them begin to ſpread; and when you graft, cut the top of the Cyen or Graft off cloſe above a Bud, about four or five Inches above the Shoulder, if it be for a Standard-tree, two Buds above the Clay being full enough; but for Dwarfs or Wall-trees, you may let the Cyens or Grafts be ſix Inches or more
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:154132:25"/>long, with ſeveral Buds, that they may ſhoot forth many Branches and ſpread from the very Stock. If you Graft old Apple, or Pear-trees, or their Branches, you muſt Graft according to the thickneſs of their Branches, which is uſually ſeven or eight Foot high or more. It will do well in Graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Stocks for large ſtandards, to put but one Cyens or Graft into a Stock (unleſs the Stock be very large, or an old Tree you Graft) and if it put forth ſeveral Shoots, to cut off all but one, that is the ſtraighteſt and ſtrongeſt: But for Dwarffs and Wall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruit, put in two Cyens if the Stock be big enough; let the later be Grafted near the ground, the former at ſuch height you think fit, and the Stock will allow.</p>

                     <p>§. 1. THere are ſeveral ways of Graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and all good, if Judiciouſly and dexterouſly performed: To which end, I ſhall endeavour to ſet down the moſt plain and exact deſcription of each way, for the better and truer information of the young Planter, and firſt begin with that call'd ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, or Packing on, which being deſcribed at large, may ſerve as a General direction for all.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Grafting call'd Slic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or Packing on.</note>§. 1. Cut off the top of Stock, in ſome ſmooth and ſtraight place, that may be Anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werable to the ſtraightneſs of the Graft, when ſet on. If you do it with a Hand-ſaw, cut it ſmooth afterwards with a Knife, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the top flat and even.</p>
                     <p>Then prepare your Cyen or Graft, (firſt obſerving which ſide is ſtraighteſt at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom or thicker end, that ſo it may fit the ſtraight part of the Stock when ſet on) by cutting the Graft or Cyen on one ſide only, from the Joint, Knot, or Seam, if the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:154132:27"/>part below it be ſmooth and ſtraight; (the Knot or Seam is a Circle round about the Graft, dividing and diſtinguiſhing the laſt Summers growth from the former) or from ſome one Bud on the lower part of the laſt years Shoot, or Sprout, down ſlopewiſe in the Wood till it be cut quite off, in that the ſlope may be about an Inch long or ſomthing more, obſerving it's bent, that when the Graft or Cyen is fixed to the Stock, it may ſtand almoſt upright; and cut the Graft or Cyen thin at the bottom of cut place, yet leave on all the Bark on the oppoſite ſide; then give a cut croſs through the Bark at the top of the Slope, and then cut a thin Chip of that Slope upward to the croſs cut, that there may be a ſhoulder to reſt on the top of the Stock, but cut not this ſhoulder too deep, little more than through the Bark will be enough, and this will cauſe a little riſing in the Sloped part, which you muſt cut down, that the whole Slope may be plain and ſmooth, without dints or riſings, and lie even and cloſe to the ſide of the Stock. Cut then the top of the Cyen off, cloſe above a Bud, about four In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches above the ſhoulder if it be for a Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard-tree, two Buds above the Clay being full enough; but for Dwarf, or Wall-trees, you may let the Cyen or Graft be ſix Inches long with ſeveral Buds, that they may ſhoot forth many Branches, and ſpread from the very Stock.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="38" facs="tcp:154132:28"/>The Cyen or Graft thus prepared, lay the cut part of the Cyen or Graft upon the ſtraight ſide of the Stock, and if it may be, on the Weſt, or South-weſt ſide of the Stock, and ſo meaſure and mark the juſt length and breadth of; it then cut away ſo much of the Bark of the Stock, as the cut part of the Cyen or Graft may fit, drawing your Knife upwards; but as the Stock is bigger, and the Bark thicker than that on the Cyen, or Graft, ſo the Chip muſt be longer and broader, or els the paſſage of the Sap in the Stock and Cyen or Graft (which is chieſly betwixt the Bark and the wood) will not meet together, which ſhould and muſt be aimed at, as in the work you will eaſily ſee.</p>
                     <p>Then lay the cut part of the Cyen or Graft on the cut part of the Stock, and let the ſhoulder of the Graft or Cyen reſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly upon the top of the Stock, ſo that the cut parts of both may joyn even and ſmooth all along, and ſo bind them together cloſe, with courſe woollen Yarn, Baſſes, or the inward peeling of the Witch-tree, if you bind with ſuch materials as will not be looſe or rotten by Midſummer; about that time give the binding a cut croſs-wiſe with a Knife to ſet the priſoners at liberty: Have in readineſs ſome Clay free from ſtones, well mixt with Horſe-dung, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (<hi>Vide</hi> Chap. 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2.) and daub it about the Stock and Cyen, an Inch above the head of the Stock,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:154132:28"/>and an Inch below the bottom of the Cyen or Graft; work it up round the Cyen or Graft till it be ſharp at the top, that the Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water may fall better off it; and with a Knife or rather a little Trowel dipt in water, ſmooth over the Clay, but in doing this, be very careful not to diſpleaſe the Cyen or Graft.</p>
                     <p>Thus you may Graft Pears, Plums, Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and Apples, if it be before the Bark of the Stock will part from the wood of them, for when it will, the next way fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing is better for Aples.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Grafting in the Back or Rind.</note>§. 2. The ſecond way call'd Grafting in the Bark is much like this, and ſome prefer it before the beformentioned, or any other way; but it can only be uſed for Apples, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all Cyens of other Fruit, will be grown paſt uſe, before the Bark of the Stock will peel, which is about the end of <hi>March</hi> or beginning of <hi>April,</hi> but this will be time enough for Apples if your Stocks be in any thing good liking, which if they be not, they are not fit to be Grafted any way: Prepare then your Stock and Cyen or Graft, exactly as your were directed in Packing, only inſtead of cutting the Bark of the Stock, ſlit it on the South-weſt ſide, from the top, almoſt as long as the ſloped part of the Cyen, and looſen the Bark at the top of the ſlit with the point of your Knife.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="40" facs="tcp:154132:29"/>Have in readineſs a little Inſtrument made of Ivory, or of a Deer or Sheep-ſhanck or Silver, or of ſome hard ſmooth wood; at one end let it be made of the ſhape of the ſlope part of the Cyen, but much leſs every way; thruſt it down betwixt the Bark and wood of the Stock where it was ſlit, to make room for the Cyen or Graft,<note place="margin">Some peel off the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt thin, brown rind of the Graft, on the oppoſite ſide to the cut and ſlope part of the Graft, that muſt enter between the Bark of the Stock and wood, but leave on all the inner green rind, and then thruſt the Graftdown between the wood and Bark of the Stock which does very well.</note> then take it out and put in the Cyen, but firſt cut a little of the Bark at the thin end of the ſlope of the Cyen or Graft, that it dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble not in going down, yet leave it with a ſharpe edge; and becauſe when your Cyen is put in, it will bear the Bark hollow from the Stock, nick or ſlit the Bark, on each ſide the Cyen, ſo that it may fall cloſe to the Stock, and to the edges of the Cyen; bind and Clay it as before.</p>
                     <p>This way of Grafting is commended by ſome, as <hi>Mr. Langford,</hi> tho others diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove thereof; yet I have Grafted large Stocks often this way, and very ſucceſsfully, but with ſmall Stocks I ſeldom had the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired Succeſs, tho as careful in the operation as poſſible; but the firſt way I take to be the beſt for them, for theſe reaſons.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. Becauſe Stocks may be Grafted ſo, ſome years before they can be ready to Graft in the Cleft, and though Whip-grafting may be uſed ſooner than that way, yet there are other great inconveniences attending it.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="41" facs="tcp:154132:29"/>II. The Stocks this way are leſs harmed than where a Cleft is uſed, becauſe the Cleft lets wet into them, and rots and makes them not ſo fit for Grafting again, (if any fail to grow the firſt time) as theſe continue to be, though they ſhould once miſcarry.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. The Cyen will much ſooner cover the Stock and make a more ſound, health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ſwifter growing Tree.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. This is more ſpeedy, eaſy, and ſure to ſucceed. Therefore if the Stock exceed three Inches Diameter at the place it's cut off, the beſt way is to Graft in the Rind or Bark, and you may ſet many Grafts round the Stock, and they will ſooner cover the Stock; but if the Stock be from one Inch to three Inches Diameter, then Graft in the Cleft; if under one Inch Diameter, then by ſlicing, Packing on, or Whip-graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>Grafting in the Rind is attended with ſome inconvenience; for the Grafts uſually make large Shoots the firſt Year, which in caſe the Wind happen to blow ſtrongly on the oppoſite ſide of the Stock where the Graft is, commonly it is broken off, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as yet no other hold than in the Bark or Rind, and being top heavy with all, is eaſily broken: but after one Year the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is paſt, becauſe that which grows ſo plentifully at the joyning of the Graft and Stock the firſt Year being but ſappy Rind, the next Year is converted into ſolid Wood.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:154132:30"/>Some well approve by their experience the Grafting Stocks above three Inches Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by placing two Grafts oppoſite to each other in the Cleft, and other two oppoſite to each other in the Bark, ſo that you may place four Grafts in ſuch a large Stock, and they will ſoon cover the Stocks head.</p>
                     <p>§. 3. There is another way of Grafting ſmall Stocks call'd Whip-grafting;<note place="margin">Whip-grafting.</note> and here your Graft or Cyen, and Stock ought to be exactly of the ſame bigneſs as the manner of performing it plainly ſhews, <hi>viz.</hi> Slope off the Cyen or Graft a full Inch or longer, and do the like to the Stock, and tye the one upon the other; both the Stock and Cyen ought to be cut at the ſmootheſt and ſtraighteſt place. You may if you will make a Shoulder on the Cyen, and cut the top of the Stock to ſuit with it, and then bind them together, and Clay them about the place. If you joyn the Inner Bark of the Cyen and Stock exactly together at either ſide, it will grow, tho not ſo well as where the Cyen and Stock are of an equal proportion.</p>
                     <p>This way call'd Whip-grafting, is ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful enough, ſo that ſpecial care be taken that both Stock and Cyen ſuit exactly where they are joyned together, which is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what troubleſome to do; and ſo is it to find Cyens and Stocks of an equal bigneſs; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the head will be apt to overgrow the Stocks; all that can be done to prevent it,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:154132:30"/>is to Graft theſe very low; or if high to give the Stock more liberty to thicken by ſlitting the Bark of it with a Knife almoſt to the wood.</p>
                     <p>In this way of Grafting there is another little Knack may be added to very good purpoſe, and that is, when the Stock and Cyen are prepared (as you heard before) to be joined together, to make a ſlit, or Notch with a Knife in the bare place of the Stock downward, beginning towards the top of the ſlope, and ſo ſlitting or Notching it a little way, and doing the like in the ſlop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed face of the Cyen, but beginning at the ſame diſtance from the lower end of it, as you did before from the top of the Stock, and ſo carrying it upwards, and then joyn them by thruſting the one ſlice into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till the bare place of the Cyen cover the bare place of the Stock.</p>
                     <p>This may be done likwiſe in Grafting by Packing, and in both conduceth much to ſtrengthen the work, and is called by ſome Lipping, or Tounging.</p>
                     <p>In Whip-grafting the cut parts both of the Graft and Stock, muſt joyn and anſwer one another from the top to the bottom.</p>
                     <p>This way of Whip-grafting is commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome, not only for the ſame reaſon as ſlitting or Packing on is, but alſo becauſe the Graft ſoon covers the Stock, which is not impaired by ſlitting or cleaving, and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:154132:31"/>the Graft having it's Wood, as well as it's Rind bound to the Stock, is not ſo apt to break off, as that which is Grafted only in the Rind, nor is the Graft apt to be top heavy, the Stocks being ſmaller af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford not ſo plentiful Nouriſhment.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Grafting in the Cleft or ſlit.</note>§. 4. The next way of Grafting is call'd Grafting in the Cleft, which is the moſt Antient and common way of Grafting, and if carefully managed, not inferior to any other way of Grafting, tho the modern Planters do ſomthing ſlight it: You may Graft any Stock this way, from half an Inch to three Inches Diameter, and that if the Stock be no bigger than the Graft too, if you have neat Tools, and be ready in the managery thereof, and with good ſucceſs, as I have frequently experienced. The manner is thus, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Cut off the top of the Stock in ſome ſmooth and ſtriaght place, that may be anſwaerble to the ſtraightneſs of the Graft that is put into the Cleft; if you do it with a Hand-ſaw, cut it ſmooth afterwards with a Knife, leaving the top flat and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                     <p>Then cleave the Stock with a ſtrong Knife, (or the Chiſel before deſcribed at <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. in <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.) Let the ſlit run about two Inches deep, and let it be as near the middle of the Stock as you can, but not in the Pith or heart, and let the ſlit be on the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:154132:31"/>ſomotheſt ſides of the Stock. Have in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs the Steel Iinſtrument before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2, or els a Stick of hard Wood near a foot long, at one end made like a Wedge; when you have taken out the Cleaver, put one end of the Inſtrument, or els the Wedge into the ſlit or cleft of the Stock, and open it ſo wide as to put in the Cyen, when it is prepared, and made ready for that purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>Which is by cutting the Graft or Cyen from the joynt, knot, or ſeam, if it be ſtraight, or els from ſome Bad on the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er end of the laſt years Shoot or Sprout down aſlope on both Sides,<note place="margin">The ſlope cut off the Graft ſhould be an Inch and half long at leaſt, if the Stock be big enough to allow it.</note> ſomthing more than an Inch long, making it thin at the bottom, and in ſhape like a Wedge, very ſmooth and even without dints or riſings, that it may joyn cloſe all along; ſo far as it goes into the Cleft of the Stock, let the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the Graft or Cyen be ſomewhat thicker than the inner ſide, unleſs the Stock be ſo big as to pinch the Cyen or Graft much, then make the Cyen or Graft as thick on that ſide that goes into the Stock as on the outſide, which will prevent the Stocks hurting the Sappy part, and Bark of the Cyen or Graft, by preſerving the outſide from being pinched too much.</p>
                     <p>You may let the Graft or Cyen have on the uppermoſt part of the ſlope, a ſhoulder on one ſide, or both, or neither; all theſe ways are uſed, but ſhouldering takes up more
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:154132:32"/>time, and makes the Cyen or Graft weaker, and ſo apter by chance to be broke off; then with your ſharp Pen-knife cut away any Jags, or roughneſs, or blackneſs that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains after cleaving, on each ſide of the Cleft of the Stock within, and ſo put in either one, or two Cyens or Grafts; if the Stock be large, place them ſo as the paſſage of the Sap betwixt the Bark and Wood both of the Stock, and Cyen or Graft may meet and joyn all along the Cleft as near as you can; for you muſt be ſure always to joyn the inner ſide of the Bark of the Cyen or Graft to the inner ſide of the Bark of the Stock all along the Cleft, that the Sap may come out of the Stock to feed the Graft and make it grow.</p>
                     <p>The Graft being thus placed in the Stock draw forth the Inſtrument, or Wedge, and Clay them cloſe on every ſide, and an Inch above the top of the Stock, and an Inch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the bottom of the Cleft, and keep Clay on about the Grafted part untill the Stock be covered with the Graft, and it will be the ſounder Tree.</p>
                     <p>If you put but one Graft or Cyen in (which is beſt unleſs the Stock be large,) then cut off a piece with a ſlope cut from the top of the Stock about an Inch and half deep on the worſt ſide of the Stock, the Graft being to be put on the ſtraighteſt and ſmootheſt ſide, in cutting the Stock thus, the Graft will cover over the ſooner.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="47" facs="tcp:154132:32"/>Many cleave big Stocks croſſwiſe again, and put in two more Cyens; but cleaving hurts the Stocks ſo much that it's better (if you will have more than two Cyens in one Stock) Graft the other two in the Bark, according to the ſecond way of Graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but forecaſting one of them to be on the Weſt ſide of the Stock; But two Grafts are enough for any Stock.</p>
                     <p>It's an Erronious practiſe to ſet the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the Stock and Graft even and ſmooth; becauſe the Bark of a big Stock is much thicker than the Bark of a ſlender Graft, and conſequently if the outſide be ſmooth and even, the inſide muſt needs be uneven, but where the Graft and Stock are almoſt of an equal proportion, there you may ſet them ſmooth on the outſide, but where the Stock is large, ſet the cut part of the Graft more inward into the Cleft of the Stock.</p>
                     <p>When you cut Grafts it's very convenient to leave a Bud or two on the outſide of the cut place, that in caſe any of the Grafts happen to be broken off, ſuch Bud or Buds on the outſide, will ſpring out, and ſupply the defect, altho the Graft be broken off, even to the top of the Stock; or you may leave the Bud juſt at the ſhoulder where the Graft joyns to the top of the Stock, and it will anſwer the ſaid intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>

                        <pb n="48" facs="tcp:154132:33"/>The only objection that is raiſed againſt Grafting in the Cleft, is, that the Stock being ſlit or cloven, the Rain is apt to get in and decay the Stock, and ſometimes the Graft too, therefore caution muſt be uſed, not only the firſt year, but untill the head of the Stock be covered with the Graft, to keep well tempered Clay on the Graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed part both, of Cyen and Stock, and that as far as the Cleft extends it ſelf, to keep out both Wet and Air.</p>
                     <p>I have Grafted this way Stocks from half an Inch to above three Inches Diameter, and that very ſuccesfully, obſerving the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid rules, but a Stock of about an Inch Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter is the beſt to uſe in this way of Graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which I like as well as any other, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the opinion of all modern Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters is to the contrary.</p>
                     <p>There is one ſmall obſervation neceſſary to be noted in Cleft-Grafting, and of no lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle concernment to make Grafts thrive well, which is to cut the Graft ſo as to be ſet as deep into the Stock as poſſible, ſo as the Stock be not clove too far, which is by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cut part of the Graft to be an Inch and half long, or longer if the Stock be large, and thereby the Graft will attract more Sap, and make a larger Graft by much, than one cut but ſhort from the Knot, Seam, or Bud. Therefore for that end make the cut part of the Graft an Inch and half long at leaſt.</p>

Side-Grafting is done by preparing the Cyen or Graft as in Whip-grafting, then without cutting off the head of the Stock, (but making it thin of ſide-Branches) from a ſmooth Place of it on the Weſt ſide, take off as much Bark as the Cyen will cover, as in Packing, and ſlit both Cyen and Stock accordingly as is directed in the third <hi>Sect.</hi> and fix them together accordingly; bind it cloſe, and Clay it.</p>

There is another way call'd Graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Approach, Ablactation, or Enarch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is by having a Stock or Stocks grow ſo near another Tree, whoſe Fruit you would propagate, that the Stock and the Branch of that Tree may be joyned together in the manner following.</p>
                     <p>Cut the ſide of the Branch, and of the Stock (where they will meet) about three Inches in length, till you come near the Pith of each, and fit them both together, that the paſſage of the Sap may joyn, and the green inner ſide of the Bark of the Stock and Tree; in which poſture bind and Clay them: Aſſoon as you find the Cyen and Stock to be well cemented together, cut off the head of the Stock about four Inches above the binding, and in <hi>March</hi> following, cut off the Stub you left of the Stock, and alſo the Cyen underneath, cloſe to the Grafted place, that it may ſubſiſt by the Stock only.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo uſed to be done by cutting off the head of the Stock at firſt, and ſlopeing half off about two Inches long, and joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Cyen thereunto, being cut accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
                     <p>This manner of Grafting is unneceſſary, and ſcarſly practicable in common Fruit-trees, but for Oranges, Lemons, Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granats, Vines, Jeſſamines and ſuch like Shrubs, it may be uſed. Alſo it's ſaid that
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:154132:34"/>Trees of different kinds will ſooner take this way than any other.</p>
                     <p>§. 7. I once ſaw a man Graft half a dozen ſmall Stocks thus; After he had cut off the top of the Stock, he cut it on each ſide from the top a ſlope about an Inch and half, directly like a Wedg reverſt, then he clove with his Pen-knife the Graft from the bottom in the middle of the Graft an Inch and half, then he plac'd this Graft on the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Some have an Iron Inſtrument made for the purpoſe, which will make a Nick or Notch in the Stock up to it's head, an Inch and half long through the Bark, and ſome depth into the Wood, in form of an v, or rather after this form, V, then fit the Graft, and put it into the Noch, joying Sap to Sap, and bind them together with Baſs, and Clay them.

                     <p>§. 1. INoculating is the taking off a Bud from one Tree, and putting it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Bark and the Wood of another Tree or Stock; the end and intention is the ſame with other ways of Grafting; and moreover by this way, divers ſorts of Fruits, which are not apt to take or grow by ordinary ways of Grafting, are by this eaſily encreaſed.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculating.</note>§. 2. About a fortnight before or after Midſummer (which is the beſt time, though it may be done from the beginning of <hi>May</hi> untill <hi>Auguſt</hi>) when you have pitcht upon ſuch Stocks as are fit to be Inoculated, to get the Bud from, chooſe out a ſtrong and well liking Branch, or Shoot of that years growth, upon a Tree that bears exceeding well, and ſuch kind of Fruits as you would by this operation produce, and about the mid le, or lower end of it, (for the top will be too tender) fix upon a leaf that hath a freſh and fair Bud growing out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:154132:35"/>it and the Bark, and about half an Inch below and above the Bud, cut off the Branch, and ſo you will have a piece of it about an Inch long remaining, with a Bud and Leaf on, this you muſt cleave juſt through the midſt, ſo as the Bud may be directly in the middle of the one half; and then ſnip off a part of the Leaf; and holding it by the remainder, clap it to a ſmooth Straight place on the Stock, and with a Pen-knife ſcore out, on each ſide of it, ſo much of the Stock as it covers, or rather a little broader, (becauſe when the Bark on which the Bud is, is taken off from it's own Wood, and applyed to the Stock, it will cover a wider ſpace of the Stock than it did before) After you have thus marked your Stock, with-draw the Cyen again, and cut the Bark through where you had marked it; then cut the Bark croſs and ſtraight from the uppermoſt end of one ſcore to the upper end of the other, and cut the Bark again croſs and ſtraight from one ſcore to the other, but not ſo low as the Lower ends of the ſcores, by a quarter of an Inch; then take the oblong ſquare piece of Bark, that is cut on every ſide, quite off the Stock, and raiſe up that part of the Bark that remains betwixt the ſide-ſcores at the bottom of the work, from the Wood, till you come to the lower end of the ſide-ſcores.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="54" facs="tcp:154132:36"/>Take then a Gooſe-quill, cut in the faſhion of an Apple-ſcoop, or ſcraper, and having with your Nail a little looſned the upper part of that Bark that is on the Cyen, thruſt the Quill betwixt the Bark and the Wood, that it may ſeparate them, and take off with the Bark a little Wood or Root of the Bud over againſt it: If you ſee a hole on the inſide over againſt the Bud, when you have taken the Bark off, caſt it away, that little labour is loſt, and try another till you find it otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>Then put in the lower end of that Bark or Cyen betwixt the Bark that was raiſed on the Stock and the Wood, and ſo bind it on the Stock gently with Woollen-yarn, or narrow Shreds of Linnen Cloth, or gentle Stuff, or with Baſſes, or Baſt, of which the Ruſſia Matts are made, but ſo that the Cyen may Lye cloſe to the Wood of the Stock that was made bare, and have an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial care that you hurt not the Bud.</p>
                     <p>§. 3. There are ſome other ways of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculating uſed, differing only in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the cut, both in the Bark of the Stock, and of the Cyen.</p>
                     <p>And firſt, ſome proceeding in all other things, as is before directed, cut the Bark out of the whole length of the ſide-ſcores, and apply the Cyen to the disbarked place.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="55" facs="tcp:154132:36"/>§. 4. Others cut one ſlit only down the Bark of the Stock, and another croſs the the top of it, like a great T, when this is done, they prepare the Cyen or Bark as before directed (only cutting it ſharp point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the lower end before they take the Bud off it's Wood) Then raiſe the Bark of the Stock up on each ſide the ſlit, and put in the Cyen, beginning at the top and ſlid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it downward gently, and let the top of the Bud joyn cloſe to the croſs-cut in the upper end, and ſo bind the Bark gently upon it, but not juſt upon the Bud: This is the common way uſed by Gardiners.</p>
                     <p>§. 5. Others make the croſs-cut in the middle of the downright ſcore on the Stock, and lifting up the four corners of the Bark, and making the Cyen ſharp at both ends, put it under the Bark of the Stock at both ends, and then bind it; but in doing this, there is danger of hurting the Bud or Cyen.</p>
                     <p>§. 6. Mr. <hi>Rea</hi> commends the making the croſs-cut at the lower end of the downright cut, and having opened the ſides, put in the Cyen upwards, being made ſharp at the upper end only.</p>
                     <p>You muſt be nimble and quick in Inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating, and preparing the Bud, els the Air by ſudden drying the Bud or Cyen and the cut part of the Stock will much be hurt.</p>

Leſt one Bud fail, or any miſchance break it, put two in every Stock, but not directly under one another on the ſame ſide of the Stock. The Branch or Shoot, you cut one Cyen off may yield you ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral.</p>
                     <p>§. 8. About a Month after the Inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating, or ſooner if you perceive the Bark ſwell where the binding is, cut off the binding.</p>
                     <p>If it grow it will fix to the Stock, keep it's colour, and that part of the Leaf and Stalk that was left, will drop off, and the Bud appear fair; Then ſometime before the next Spring, cut off the top of the Stock a hands breath above the place it was Inoculated at, and all the ſide-branches that grow any where upon the Stock; and at Spring the Bud will put forth; and if any other Sprouts or Buds appear on the Stock, cut them off.</p>
                     <p>§. 9. If the firſt Inoculation fail, or the Buds dye, the Stocks may be Inoculated again the next Summer, and of ſuch as are Inoculated timely in the year, it may be ſometimes ſeen whether they grow or not,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:154132:37"/>time enough to Inoculate them again the ſame year.</p>
                     <p>§. 10. Apricocks will have Buds ready ſooner than other Fruit, ſo that you may begin with them and follow with the other.</p>
                     <p>§. 11. Stocks raiſed of Peach-ſtones are commonly big enough to be Inoculated the ſecond Summer, ſometimes the Firſt after they are ſet: when they or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther stocks are an Inch and half in compaſs, or thereabouts, they are big enough to be Inoculated.</p>
                     <p>§. 12. Thoſe you intend for Wall or Dwarf-trees, are to be Inoculated within a handfull of the ground, and not Pruned at all, till you remove them, and then you will better ſee whats neceſſary to be cut off; and theſe you may remove after one years growth, or two, with more ſafety.</p>
                     <p>If you Inoculate any Plums, Pears, Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or other Fruit, that you intend for an Orchard, or other place for tall Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dards, you may do it higher on the Stocks, <hi>viz.</hi> ſix or ſeven foot high, and Prune theſe up in the Nurſery, and let them grow there, two or three years (according as
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:154132:38"/>they grow in hight) before they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.</p>
                     <p>§. 13. After Stocks that are Inoculated have made one or two years growth, you muſt cut off the head of the Stock, that remain'd above the Bud: At your firſt cutting it, cut it cloſe to the new Branches, that it may grow over the cut; let it be cut a little ſlope, and Clay'd over, if you deſire the Branch ſhould quickly cover it; and the ſooner it doth the better.</p>
                     <p>§. 14. Care muſt be had in chooſing Branches or Shoots from which you are to have your Buds, that they be of Shoots of the ſame years growth you Inoculate; and of ſtrong growth, the Bark firm, and not ſpungy; ſuffer them to fade as little as may be before you uſe them; and the Shoots muſt be got from Trees that your own or others experience can faithfully aſſure you not only to be good Fruit, but very good bearers; and if the Fruit you deſign to raiſe, be at ſuch a diſtance that you cannot have Buds to Inoculate the ſame day they are cut, put them in wet Moſs or Graſs in a Box, and ſo they will keep a day and a night very well. But if by carriage in the Air or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they are a little withered, you may revive them by ſetting them in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:154132:38"/>which will make the Buds come clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner from the Wood.</p>
                     <p>§. 15. Nectarins, Peaches, and Apri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks are ſeldom raiſed otherwiſe than by Inoculation; becauſe they will rarely or never grow by Grafting; but Pears, Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or Plums take and grow full as well by Grafting as Inoculation. The Bark of Cyens taken from ſome Plums, is ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and ſpungy they will often miſcarry when Inoculated: ſuch one be ſure to raiſe rather by Grafting, tho many Plums will hit very well being Inoculated.</p>
                     <p>Cyens of Apples fail for the moſt part, when you Inoculate Buds of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Bark is tender, and Buds weak.</p>
                     <p>Cherries and Pears take very ſure being Inoculated on young freſh Stocks, whoſe Bark is not very thick.</p>
                     <p>§. 16. Upon conſideration of all, I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe the Planter to raiſe all his Fruit-trees by Grafting, as being both the ſureſt and eaſieſt way; only his Peaches, Nectarins, and Apricocks can be propagated only by Inoculating; yet where Inoculating ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds well, it's eſteemed and prefer'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Grafting, for the following reaſons. 1. Becauſe the Stock will be big enough to Inoculate by two or three years ſooner than to Graft, and your Plant groweth much
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:154132:39"/>faſter after the nature is ſo alter'd than it did before, and will be ſooner ready to tranſplant than if it be ſuffer'd to grow two or three years longer, as it muſt be before it be ready to be Grafted. 2. It makes a ſounder Tree than one that is Grafted, eſpecially in the Cleft; becauſe it covereth the Stock ſpeedily and well. 3. It hurts not the Stock ſo much as Graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and if it chance to fail, it may be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculated next year again, and ſometimes the ſame year. 4. Some look upon In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculating to be more ſpeedy, eaſy and delightſome than Grafting, and may be practiſed by Gentlemen, who in <hi>June</hi> may lye on the ground and do it; whereof they cannot ſo well bear the cold without danger of taking hurt in <hi>February,</hi> or <hi>March,</hi> which is the choice of Grafting ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                     <p>If you do Inoculate any Buds of Pear, Cherry, or Plum, let the Shoots be very ſtrong and large, but you had better Graft them.</p>
                     <p>§. 17. Not only the Pith, but alſo the Wood of the Bud is caſt away in Inoculating, and nothing made uſe of but the Buds and Bark of any young Shoot, and yet they bring forth the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:154132:39"/>ſame Fruit as the Tree whence they are got.</p>
                     <p>§. 18. It's debated among Planters what time of the day is beſt for Inoculating;<note place="margin">Time of the day to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculate.</note> ſome perſons argue ſtiffly for the morning; becauſe there paſleth up much more Sap or juice in the day-time than in the night, as they obſerve in piercing the Birch-Tree, and other Trees to get the liquor out of them for Phyſical uſes; and conſequently the Bud Inoculated in the morning, muſt be more likely to grow, having the whole days plenty of Sap to invite it to unite with the Stock, than if it be Inoculated late in the day, and ſo muſt be diſcouraged in it's new habitation by the niggardly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of the nights Sap.</p>
                     <p>If you follow this advice, you had beſt wrap ſome broad Leaves or Fern about the Stock; ſo as to ſhade the Cyen from the Scorching heat of the day following, to prevent it's drying before the Stock hath undertaken the charge of preſerving it.</p>
                     <p>But this work may be done in the heat of the day, if the heat be not violent, and then you muſt (as at all times you ought) be very quick in the doing of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="62" facs="tcp:154132:40"/>And for all that hath been ſaid before, the afternoon may be as good a time as any; becauſe if the Bud have leſs liquor afforded it in the night, then the cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that time makes it leſs thirſty; and as it's thirſt encreaſeth by the heat of the next day, a more plentiful Stream will be very ſeaſonable to ſatisfy it.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of Pruning Fruit-Trees.</head>
                     <p>§. 1. AFter Grafts have had their full growth the firſt year, they muſt be Pruned, ſuch as need it; Thoſe that are Grafted low and yet muſt be made Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dards, or tall Trees, leave only one Shoot, the ſtrongeſt and biggeſt, and let not that Shoot begin to ſpread untill it be ſeven foot high at leaſt; therefore cut off all the ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branches, till they are grown to the hight you deſire. If to ſpred low, let ſome be left on each ſide, that the boughs on any one ſide may grow ſtraight upright. As for Wall-plants it's no matter of how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Branches they ſpread, the more the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Now unleſs young Grafts put forth a ſtrong and luſty Shoot, Prune not off all the ſide-branches, leſt the body of the Plant be too ſmall and limber to bear his head; therefore if the body be very ſlender ſuffer ſome of the ſide-twigs to grow, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the Body be of a ſufficient ſtrength to bear the top, and from year to year Prune off thoſe Shoots and Branches as are ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:154132:41"/>and grow too near one another, interfere, fret and gall each other, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve only ſuch as are fit to make the Tree of a comly form; and ſuffer them not the firſt three years (at leaſt) to grow thick and buſhy-headed, by cutting off ſome of the inſide-ſhoots, and ſuch as grow croſs one another, or pendent.</p>
                     <p>§. 2. What you cut off the Body, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Branch, do it cloſe and even, that the Bark may grow over it.</p>
                     <p>§. 3. If you cut part of any Shoot, or of a Cyen for Grafting, cut it cloſe at a Bud, that the cut may be cover'd with a freſh Sprig, and the wound may again grow up, and a Stub-end not be left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind.</p>
                     <p>§. 4. At what hight ſoever, or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever you would have the Tree, or any Branch, or Shoot to ſpread, there top it, that is cut off a Bud, an Inch of the very top cloſe at a Bud, and there it will ſpread.</p>
                     <p>§. 5. When Trees grow big that a Knife will not Prune them, uſe the broad Chiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el (mention'd in <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2.) with which, and a Mallet, you may take off a Bough or large Branch, as you will, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either hurting the Bark of the Tree, by cutting too near, or leaving a Stump,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:154132:41"/>by not cutting near enough; one of which is not eaſily avoided by the chance blows of an Ax, or Hatchet, and being amongſt thick boughs your Chiſel and Mallet will be more governable than other Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; If the boughs are very large you may uſe a Saw firſt, and then ſmooth it with the Chiſel.</p>
                     <p>§. 6. Trees growing in Orchards, Fields, or Hedges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> muſt be Pruned from year to year as need is, in <hi>November,</hi> or <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> by cutting off ſuperfluous Branches and ſuch as croſs one another, and grow too cloſe; leave no dead Twigs or Branches, and ſcrape off the Moſs on the body, or Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Tree.</p>
                     <p>§. 7. Concerning the Pruning and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Wall-trees, ſee hereafter, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. And you muſt not Prune thoſe Plants you intend for the Wall, untill tranſplant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſet at the Wall.</p>
                     <p>§. 8. Prune not much and often, if you love Fruit more than a Tree to thrive in Wood; therefore whilſt your Tree is young, bring it unto a handſome ſhape and order, and when it comes to beat Fruit forbear Pruning, unleſs in caſe of broken, or ſuch boughs as grow croſs, or gall, or fret others.</p>
                     <p>

                        <note place="margin">Touching the height of Fruit-trees.</note>§. 9. And here I muſt beg leave to thwart and contradict the opinions of all our modern Planters, who applaud the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Trees not to be above an ell high before they ſpread: Their reaſons are theſe that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.
<list>
                           <item>1. Becauſe the low Trees ſooner at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to be Fruit-bearing Trees, and grow fairer than the tall; the Sap and juice waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in its long ball and paſſage, which in the ſhorter Trees expends it ſelf ſoon in the Branches.</item>
                           <item>2. You may Plant more of them in the like quantity of Land, becauſe the ſhadow of the one Tree doth not reach the ground of the other, as that of the tall Tree doth.</item>
                           <item>3. The lower and broad ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tree is the greater bearer, by reaſon the bloſſoms in the Spring are not ſo obvious to the bitter Blaſts, nor the Fruit in the Autumn to the fierce and deſtructive Winds.</item>
                           <item>4. Fruits are more eaſily gather'd from a low than a tall Tree, beating or ſhaking down Fruit from ſuch Trees being to be rejected by all judicious Cyderiſts.</item>
                           <item>5. Any Fruit on a low well ſpread Tree, is better and fairer than that on a tall Tree, by the ſame reaſon that the Tree is fairer, becauſe the Sap is not ſo much waſted in the low and humble Tree, as in the tall and lofty by its large Trunck.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding theſe reaſons ſeem plauſible, yet experience aſſures, that a Tree of a reaſonable height (I mean not high like Tymber Trees) bears as well as the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:154132:42"/>and if you obſerve a due diſtance, which ought to be, the ſhade will not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious; and tho Fruit on a low Tree is eaſily gathered, yet the other may be with ſome little pains gathered well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
                     <p>But if you deſign to uſe the Land under, or about the Trees you plant, either in Orchard, Field, or Hedg, for the Syth, Spade, or Graſing of Cattle eſpecially, let your Trees be ſeven foot high at leaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they begin to ſpread, becauſe you can ſcarce ſo cautiouſly preſerve them, but Cattle will ſomtime or other get into your Orchard, and then they will not a little endamage your Fruit-trees, if low, by nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping off the Buds of all boughs within their reach; and if you chance to farm the Orchard, your Tenants in deſpight of all Covenants to the contrary, will either be negligent, malitious, or ſo covetous as to permit Cattel to Graze in the Orchard, to your no little damage, which by letting them be ſeven foot high before they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſpread, will be infallibly prevented. But where you intend Trees for Table-fruit to he ſet in the Borders of Gardens or Walks, there you may let them ſpread within an ell and leſs of the Earth, as you ſhall hereafter be more fully inſtructed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="68" facs="tcp:154132:43"/>§. 10. In Pruning Trees be cautious of cutting off the ſmall Sprigs, which are the more apt to bear Fruit, it being too uſual for ignorant Planters, to beautify their Trees, by taking off theſe ſuperfluous branches (as they term them) whereby they deprive themſelves of the Furit.</p>
                     <p>§. 11. Cherry-trees muſt be Grafted at the hight you would have them ſpread, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſix or ſeven Foot high, unleſs for the Wall, and then within a Foot of the ground.</p>
                     <p>§. 12. Prune the Heads of ſome ſort of Trees that have but ſmall Pith as Apple-trees, Pear-trees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when you remove them, to proportion the Branch and Root as near as you can; but Cherry-trees, Plum-trees, Walnut-trees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that have a large Pith are not to be top't, only ſome of the ſide Branches may be taken away.</p>
                     <p>If you cut part of any Shoot, or a Cyen for Grafting, cut it cloſe at a Bud or Sprig, and the wound will again grow up, and a Stub end not left behind.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Cherry and Codling Hedge diſtances.</note>§. 3. Of late times it's uſed to make Cherry-hedges in Gardens and Orchards, and Hedges of Codlings, Nurſ-gardens, Plums, and ſuch like Trees that may be kept by cutting and plaiſhing one Branch within another, and from growing very large; theſe are uſually made along the ſide of Walks, or round about a Garden-plot, and are Ornamental to a Garden be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ordered and kept handſomly.</p>
                     <p>Trees for theſe purpoſes are to be ſet about a yard, or an ell aſunder; for they ſhould near meet the firſt year, and ſhould be thus ordered, <hi>viz.</hi> ſtretch a line from one end to the other where the Hedg is to be made, and ſet the Trees ſtraight at the diſtance aforeſaid: Afterwards knock down a Stake betwixt each Tree, then having ſtraight long Rods, or Poles of Aſh, or the

<list>
                           <item>1. The Plantation will be little Annoyance to the Land, if either you ſet Gooſ-berries, Currens, Ras-berries, Straw-berries, or Garden ſtuff in it; ſow Corn on it while the Trees are young, or graze it when they are grown up.</item>
                           <item>2. Whereas ſome ſay the more Trees the more Fruit; that's abſolutely falſe; for when they are ſet ſo cloſe, that the Sun can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have a good influence on them, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing the Roots, Body, Branches, Bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms and Fruits, they bear poorly, and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:154132:45"/>ripen worſe; and cloſe-ſet Trees in a few years when they ſhould bear Fruits, croud, fret, and gall one another, and by rubbing often cauſe the Canker.</item>
                           <item>3. They cannot grow to be Trees of that ſize as they would (if the Land be good) being ſet at a good diſtance, and ſome kind of Trees being of ſtronger and ſwifter growth than others, will ſo domineer over their neighbors, that they will make them almoſt good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and one Tree that is ſet at a fair diſtance will bear oftner, and more Fruit than three, or four Trees ſet cloſe, as is dayly ſeen by ſome Apple-trees that grow ſingle, or in a Hedge.</item>
                           <item>4. You may Plant betwixt every Tree, a Cherry-tree, Plum-tree, or Codling-tree, which may grow up and bear with the other Trees many years, and never reach or Prejudice them, but will decay before the others are at full growth; Or you may ſet a young Apple-tree, or Pear-tree betwixt every two of your Standards that you ſet in the Orchard, and nurſe it up with neceſſary dreſſing and Pruning ſeven or eight years, or leſs time, to tranſplant into Fields or Paſture-land, where Cattle feed; whereby with little help it will not be in ſuch danger of hurt from Cattel as ſmall ones would, and bear Fruit ſoon after it's ſet, and you cannot let them grow ſo long in your Nurſery without galling, fretting, or hurting one
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:154132:45"/>another, unleſs when you remove Trees out of your Nurſery, you take care to leave every other Tree, whereby they may have liberty to grow big, and ſo more fit for your Fields.</item>

                     <p>SO far as it lyeth in ones power to chooſe a plot of Ground for an Orch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, let it be done with reſpect to the following advantages</p>
                     <p>§. 1. It ſhould lye conveniently near him, declining and lying open towards the South, South-eaſt, or South-weſt, and defended from the North, North-eaſt, and North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt Winds by buildings, Woods, or high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Grounds; the Land ſhould rather incline to dryneſs than moiſture, without Springs, the Soyl deep and a fat Earth, not a ſtiff, cold Clay, or binding Gravel, nor a light, ſandy, esky or hollow Earth; yet with good Husbandry, if it run not into the extreams of any of theſe, Fruit-trees may proſper reaſonably well in it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="75" facs="tcp:154132:46"/>§. 2. The natural Soil for an Orchard is more to be reſpected than a Garden; for the Garden Fruit-trees, and what els groweth there, rooteth little deeper than it may be eaſily manured; but Pear-trees and Apple-trees in Orchards ſhould grow to be large Trees, and therefore ſend forth Roots broad and deep, ſo that it tranſcends all coſt and pains to enrich the Ground for them, as far as the Roots every way reach.</p>
                     <p>§. 3. But they that are ſeated or fixed in any place, and cannot conveniently change their habitation, muſt be content with their own, and if any defect or diſadvantage be in it, it may be it hath ſome advantage that another wants, if it lye to the North, the Trees Bud and Bloſſom the later, and many times the Fruit thereby ſucceeds the better, and is free from the injurious South-winds in the Autumnal ſeaſon.</p>
                     <p>§. 4. If it lye to the Eaſt, it hath not only the advantage of being later Budded, and blown, becauſe of the cold Eaſterly Winds in the Spring, but the Fruit ripens the better, the morning Sun in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer being by much the beſt, and the Fruits freed from the Weſtern Winds, which with the South are the worſt.</p>

                        <pb n="76" facs="tcp:154132:47"/>§. 5. If your Land be on a dry, or riſing Ground, you may Plant them the thicker, which will cover and ſhade the Ground the ſooner, and make them bear the better; the Fruit will alſo yield a more vinous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor.</p>
                     <p>§. 6. If your Ground lye in a cold moiſt Vale, the ſooner may you raiſe a natural Fence about it, to defend your Trees from cold Winds, and ſtiff Guſts, which diverſly anoy your Trees and Fruits; and I once knew a perſon that had a cold moiſt flat ſpringey plot of Ground, who cauſed double Ditches to be made therein, at ten yards diſtance, each from other, and about an Ell high; upon theſe Ditches he planted Apple-trees each ten yards diſtant from another, which Trees did grow, proſper, and bear exceeding well.</p>
                     <p>§. 7. But if you have liberty to chooſe what Land you will for Planting of Fruit-trees, obſerve the directions given in the firſt <hi>Section</hi> of this <hi>Chap.</hi> and chooſe a warm, light Rye-land, or either a black or brown mold, if with a mixture of Sand, ſo much the better, but the heavy cold and moiſt Wheat-land is not ſo good.</p>

If the Ground be very light and rich of it felf, or ſo made by improvement, ſeveral ſorts of Apple-trees, eſpecially the Pippin, will be ſo apt to canker, that they will ſcarce ever be large Trees; therefore a firm and ſtrong Land; is beſt for Winter or long laſting Fruit; but for Summer-fruit, Land cannot be too light; the more it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines to redneſs the better.</p>

                        <note place="margin">How to qualify the Ground.</note>§. 9. If the Land you intend for it be a Turf or Green-ſward, you ought to Plow it two years before you ſet your Trees in it, to make it mellow and looſe, that the Trees may be better take Root, and you may then lay on Manure, which by Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will be well mixt with the natural Soil, and uſe ſuch Manure as will beſt ſuit to amend it; and if you ſow the Ground a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ten days after the Midſummur before you Plant, with Turneps, and when they are got off, which will be about <hi>November,</hi> if you pleaſe, then ſet your Trees, they will like well.</p>
                     <p>§. 10. Where the natural Soil is not good of it ſelf, whether it be in Garden, Orchard, or Field, there it ought to be by skill aſſiſted and better'd, at leaſt wiſe for ſuch a compaſs as the Roots of every Tree take up for ſome time, if not ſo far round as they are ever like to extend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>

                        <pb n="78" facs="tcp:154132:48"/>And this muſt be done by mixing ſuch Manures with the Soil as ſuit beſt with it's temper. If the Soil be Clay, or Clay mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Gravel or wet heavy Land, hot Dung, as that of Horſes, or Poultry, or for want of that, of Oxen or Cows is beſt to mix with it, to bring it to a due tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament.</p>
                     <p>And if the Soil be light, hollow, esky, or ſandy Land; Marl, Mud out of a Pond, Ditch, or River, or ſhovelings of Dirty yards or Highways, if they be not Sandy, and be well Mellowed, by lying on heaps, and eſpecially if thoſe heaps are mixed with Lime, are proper to mend it.</p>

                     <p>It hath been ſeen that an Apple-tree on a Hemp-but, which was conſtantly Plowed, and Manured to a great richneſs, bore more Apples than four ſuch Trees in an Orchard would do; and it's conſtantly ſeen in Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren hungry Land, Trees thrive poorly, grow Moſſey, or Bark-bound, bearing ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and that a poor Fruit: Only Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut-trees and Pear-trees do not neceſſarily require a very rich Ground, and will proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per beſt on Stony, and light Land.</p>

If your Land is very flat, that wet is apt to ſtand upon it, or be a ſhallow Soil, you may ſomthing help it in Plowing, alſo by gathering the Land always up in and near the place where you intend the Rows of Trees ſhall afterwards ſtand, which in two years time will ſomthing raiſe it, and thicken the Soil, and the Furrows ſo made will help to carry off the Water, or which is better, raiſe the Land on broad Ridges, that the middle of them may be about 24, or 30 Foot diſtance, according as you intend to Plant your Trees: Let the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals between the Ridges be about eight Foot broad, and the Earth taken up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween, about a Foot deep, and caſt on the Ridges which will make the Ground thicker of the beſt Soil than before it was, that the Roots of the Trees you Plant on the Ridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es cannot run down, nor ſpread into the bad Soil, which otherwiſe it would do; by this means the Trees will thrive and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per well, as may be perceived on the Banks of ſome Land, and the Hedges, that Apple-trees will thrive better there than on the Level-land.</p>

Encloſe your Orchard with a good double Ditch about four Foot high, and plant thereon two Rows of good Hawthorn, or Whitethorn, which will be an excellent Fence by the time that the Fruit-trees bear, to keep out Cattel from cropping the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Twigs of the Fruit-trees, and rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt their Stems, and unruly People from deſtroying the Fruit. Good White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn being the beſt Quick-fence for your Orchard, when it's grown up may be plaiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the better to prevent Hogs or Sheep for creeping into it. Set no ſmooth Quick in it, that may grow to great Trees, becauſe they will be hurtful both to the Hedg and Fruit-trees, both by their tops and Roots when they are grown up: Having ſet two Rows of good Hawthorn, and made the dead Hedg on the out-ſide the Ditch, the Quick-ſet will grow the faſter, for the dead Hedg upon the Ditch is apt to choak the Quick-ſets, and thus with ſomtimes Weeding it you may ſoon raiſe a good Fence.</p>
                     <p>If you have an old Hedg already about your Orchard, ſcour the Ditch and plaiſh the Hedg, and cut down all big Trees that grow in it, unleſs on the North, and Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, the one requiring a defence to keep

                     <p>Some are alſo for Planting a Defence on the weſt-ſide, to protect them from the brisk Autumnal Winds, which blow down the Fruit before ripe.</p>

It's the beſt way to remove Trees very young, as at three years growth, if they may be ſecured from danger, which in Orchards or Fields where Cattle have liberty to feed, they cannot well be with ordinary Fencing, unleſs they be of five or ſix years growth after Grafting.

                        <note place="margin">Coaſting Trees.</note>§. 1. IN removing any big Tree, men generally obſerve to Coaſt them, that is, to place the ſame ſide of the Tree to the South-Eaſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as grew formerly that way where it ſtood before; to which end before you remove it, you had beſt make ſome mark in the Bark of the Tree which way it ſtood, this you may obſerve in ſtraight Trees, but it's more material if your Trees lean one way more than an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, to ſet the leaning ſide towards the South-weſt, from whence the ſtrongeſt Winds blow; but notwithſtanding this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, you need not mind it in ſmall Trees, or ſuch that have grown in cloſe-Nurſeries; they not being capable of any conſiderable alteration from any Aſpect of the Heavens.</p>
                     <p>In caſe a Tree before removal hath the benefit of the Eaſt, or Weſt Sun, more than of the South, then Plant that Tree that before had that advantage, on the like
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:154132:55"/>again in it's new place, which altho it va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from the directions aforeſaid, yet not from the reaſon of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">How to take up Trees to be Tranſplant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note>§. 2. Be carefull in taking up the Plants; dig round about them, and take off the Mold from their Roots; if it be a ſmall Plant, it may be drawn up eaſily, the Mold being taken away, if it be great, and the Roots ſpread much, then they may be cut about half a yard from the body of the Plant, and the greater it is, the further off cut the Roots, and ſo draw it up; but keep the Spade from coming too near the Tree, by ſurrounding the Tree at a good diſtance, and endeavour to raiſe as much Earth as you can with the Tree, but if it be to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry far, ſhake it off; then pick off all the Leaves, if they be not fallen off, becauſe the Sun and Air by their means extract the Sap out of the Branches.</p>
                     <p>Pear-trees have ordinarily more brittle Roots than Apple-trees, and the Roots of Apple-trees, or Stocks, raiſed of the Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels of good Fruit, are more brittel than thoſe raiſed of Crab or wilding Kernels; therefore take more care and pains in open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ground deeper and wider, when you take up the more tender and brittle Root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Plants, and pull not over hard, leſt you leave moſt of the Roots behind.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="94" facs="tcp:154132:56"/>
                        <note place="margin">Young Trees beſt to ſet.</note>§. 3. Young Trees of three or four years old at moſt when removed, do not only grow ſurer, but make a larger growth at firſt Planting, than greater and elder Trees can do, and are therefore beſt to tranſplant.</p>
                     <p>§. 4. If your Trees have lain ſome time out of the Ground, or been carried in the Wind or Froſts, that their Roots ſeem to be dry, ſet them over night in Water, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merging only the Roots, and it will very much revive them; or when you Plant them, after you have added an indifferent quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Earth, caſt in a Pail or more of Water as the largneſs of the Foſs or hole requires, which not only quickens the Roots, but makes the Earth adhere there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, which otherwiſe would lye light and hollow about them. The Air does much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commode the Root of any Plant whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and ſo does Froſt.</p>
                     <p>§. 5. One may Carry young Trees many Miles to be tranſplanted;<note place="margin">How to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Trees for Carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> being carefully taken up, lay the Roots all one way, the ſmalleſt and tendereſt in the middle of the Bundle, and bind them cloſe from the Roots to their tops with a ſoft band, and then ſtuff the Roots round about with Straw, Hay, Moſs and the like; afterwards bind the bundle all over from the Roots to the very top with Hay, or Straw-bands, or
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:154132:56"/>ſomething els, to preſerve them from brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and wrap ſomething abouts the Roots, a piece of an old ackcloth, or any thing that will preſerve the Roots from the Wind, Sun, and from bruiſing: And in Winter you may carry young Trees thus many Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Miles.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Set upon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval in a better Soil.</note>§. 7. It muſt always be obſerved that upon every removal of Fruit-trees, to Plant or ſet them again into as good or better Soil as that out of which they were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
                     <p>But if that cannot be, then Plant, and ſet them for ſo far as the Roots may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend in three or four years growth in as good or better Mold than that out of which they were removed, by laying good Soils under, upon, and about the Roots at the ſetting; for after they have taken Root two or three years, they will then grow in ordinary Soils; the great danger is at firſt Planting, which is the reaſon Trees proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per abundantly better taken out of courſe and barren Nurſeries, than out of thoſe whoſe Soils are very rich, either by nature, or improvement: therefore be ſure to lay as good or better Soil upon, under, and about the Roots when they are ſet again, if you expect your Trees proſper.</p>

                        <pb n="96" facs="tcp:154132:57"/>
                        <note place="margin">Set not Trees deep but ſhallow.</note>§. 8. Take heed of ſetting the Roots of your Plants too deep below the good Soil, for if ſet ſhallow they proſper far better, than ſuch as are ſet deep; becauſe in the top of the Earth is the beſt Mold, ſo made by the Suns influence thereon, and every ſhower of Rain reaches, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhes, and feeds the Roots: for all may eaſily obſerve Trees thrive beſt where the Roots run near the Surface, and not at all where Planted deep; becauſe by deep Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they thruſt down their Roots below the good Soil into that which is barren and unfruitful; which cauſes your Trees to be injured by Canker, Moſs, and to be bad bearers, and ill thrivers.</p>
                     <p>§ 9. Cut away many of the Branches of all large Trees you ſet,<note place="margin">Prune the Branches and Roots at removal.</note> becauſe every removal is a check to nature, and their growth, and the Roots being cut, yield for ſome years but a faint nutriment, ſcarce ſufficient to preſerve life, much leſs to make a large growth: But Plants of a leſſer ſize need not have their Branches cut, unleſs they croſs one another, grow too nigh to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, or run up too high without ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but cut off the ends of all the Roots; becauſe if cut, many ſmall Fibra's or ſtrings ſhoot out of the cut place, which draw nouriſhment for the Plant, which without cutting would not.</p>

                        <hi>See before</hi> Sect. <hi>the ſecond, in</hi> Chap. 8.</p>
                     <p>§. 10. Make a hole about one yard ſquare and two Foot deep; but if your Soil be wet, or binding Gravel, or ſuch like,<note place="margin">How to ſet Trees.</note> very bad in the bottom, go not ſo deep, it will be better to ſet them ſhallow, and raiſe the Earth about them; And if not manur'd Land you ſet them in, have in readineſs ſome very fine rich Mold, or ſhovelings of a Yard where Cattle are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently lodged or fed, or well temper'd Street-dirt, or the Mold of rotten Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, or the Sediments of Currents that ſettle in the bottoms of Pools, or Ditches, that have lain long on heaps, till the ſame are become mellow and dry; eſpecially if ſome Lime be at caſting out mixt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, or rotten Neats-dung, which you may mix with the Earth that came forth of the hole; and ſo order it, that it may be as good or better than that out of which the Trees came; Fill the hole full half way up with this, and tread it down in ſuch form (having reſpect to the Roots of the Tree that is to be ſet in it) that the Roots may reſt cloſe upon it, then cut off the ends of all the Roots like unto a Deers foot on the underſide, they'l put forth new Roots the better, (if the Tree have one long down-right Root (call'd the Tap, or Heart-root) cut it almoſt half off) then clay
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:154132:58"/>your Tree in, and fill up the hole with the Mold, by caſting in the ſmalleſt and beſt next to the Roots, and be careful that all the ſmall Mold run between all the Roots; to that end, ſtir and ſhake the Plant, that there may not be any hollow place where the Mold ſalls not, and with your hand, draw up the uppermoſt Roots, and part them that they may ſpread in the Mold e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way; Fill up the hole with the Mold, and uſe all diligence to Place the Roots of your Tree in the ſame poſture they were in before you removed it. If the Tree be young, and the Roots ſlender, this can be performed no way but by throwing in a little Soil at a time, and then raiſing up with your hands ſuch Roots as are preſſed down by it below their proper ſituation, ſpreading them on the Soil you have caſt in, and then throwing in more, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Roots as before, ſo continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to do till you have fill'd up the hole.</p>
                     <p>Old Trees with ſturdy Roots require not ſo much curioſity, but be ſure that the Mold lye cloſe under, betwixt, and among the Roots.</p>
                     <p>If the Soil be light, preſs it down gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with your foot; then cover them half a yard about with Straw, Weeds, Litter, Fern, or the like, which will keep the Roots warm all Winter, and moiſt and cool in the following Summer; but if your Ground
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:154132:58"/>be not very rich, cover the top about the Tree with Dung.</p>
                     <p>Note that Dung is not good to lay next the Roots of your Trees, unleſs it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to Mold by it's long lying and rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſs, but Dung is better, being mixed with the Earth laid next the Roots of Trees than alone.</p>
                     <p>§. 11. Forget not to water all Trees you Plant, either very early or late.</p>

                        <note place="margin">To Stake Trees.</note>§. 12. Standard-trees Planted in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen place ſhould for a year or two be ſtaked, if they be large Trees in danger to be ſhaken by the Winds; for a Tree at firſt ſetting ſhould not be ſhaken, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter two or three years Rooting, ſhaking is good: If they ſtand in a ſad Earth, not Plowed or digged, knock down a ſtraight Stake cloſe to every Tree, and tye the Plant faſt to it with a Hay-band or other ſoft Band, and be careful to prevent galling or fretting by interpoſing and wrapping the Hay-band once or twice about the Tree before you tye it to the Stake; ſet the Stake leaning towards the Coaſts you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the greateſt Winds, and let not your Stakes continue above a year and half.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Watering Trees.</note>§. 13. Trees being Planted, it's very good to keep yearly the Ground Digged or Plowed about them for the firſt ſeven
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:154132:59"/>years, which will conduce much to their growth, and preſerve them from Moſs, and other diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p>If you are enforced to remove a Tree in Summer, take the Earth you digged out of the Foſs or hole you intend to Plant your Tree in, and mix and temper it well with an equal quantity of Cow-dung, and as much water as will make it into a Liquid pap; fill the hole almoſt with this, and let the Root of the Tree gently ſink in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it; cover it over with the Mold, and lay ſome Fern or Litter over all, and once a Month water it, and it will grow well.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">To help Trees on barren Soil.</note>§. 14. If your Land be not rich on which your Trees grow, it's exceeding good in <hi>October, November,</hi> or <hi>December</hi> to lay on the top of the Earth about them, Lees of Wine, the waſhing of ſtrong-bear Barrels, Blood of Cattle, dead Dogs, or any Carrion, Swines-dung mixed with Earth, once in three or four years, but have a care that you lay not too much, and too often about them, alſo Soap-ſuds, when cold, and Soap-aſhes are alſo good. And if your Trees be grown out of the reach of Cattle, you may ſuffer them to ly amongſt them in the Winter from Michaelmas till <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</hi>

                        <note place="margin">About bad bearing Trees.</note>§. 15. Trees of good bearing kinds will uſually bear after they are four or five years old, untill extream old age, unleſs they grow on barren Soil, or ſomtimes they'l not bear whil'ſt they grow very ſtrong, luſtily and vigorouſly, and have too great a ſupply of Sap; but after ſome years they'l then bear well, if they were Grafted of good bearing kinds; but in caſe Trees are Wall-trees and ſhoot exceſſively, and bear not, then abate their overful and rank fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile nouriſhment, by putting in Sand, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing that is barren inſtead of the fat Soil, and cut off one or two of the biggeſt Roots from the body, that ſo it may have leſs nouriſhment, and that left will turn to Fruits; and bend downwards alſo the Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and faſten them to the Wall with their tops as low as may be, which reſtrains and obſtructs the exceſſive riſing of Sap, which riſing moderately turns to Fruits. But if Trees are naturally bad bearers, there is no other remedy, but Grafting them again with Grafts taken from ſome good bearing kinds, which are known by yearly experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to bear Fruits well and abundantly.</p>

                        <note place="margin">To Graft old Trees.</note>§. 16. When Fruit-trees are grown to extream old Age, and therefore bear little, cut off their heads or big Boughs, not ſtraight over, but aſlope, that Rain and moiſture may not reſt on the top to Rot it. Theſe will put forth many young Shoots
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:154132:60"/>next Summer, which may be Grafted the Spring after with good bearing kinds; and theſe old Bodies having young heads which draw up Sap vigorouſly, will bear ſtore of Fruits many years after; or you may cut off their heads even and ſmooth, and put two Grafts in the Cleft, and two in the Rind, and they will ſoon cover their heads, if you keep well temper'd Clay continually on and about their heads.

                     <p>AS for the Soil, diſtance, and Stocks for Wall-Trees you are before in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed; It remains only to ſay ſomething that before has not been touched on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Setting Wall-trees.</note>§. 1. Make a Trench by the Wall-ſide you are to ſet them up to, about two Foot broad, and as deep, and in every place where a Tree is to be ſet, about a yard ſquare, mingle good old rotten Neats-dung with the Earth, and fill it up near as high as you intend the Borders to be, and when you have filled it up about half full, tread it down; but if you deſign no Borders, make then only a hole about a yard ſquare; but if your Soil be wet, or binding Gravel, or ſuch like, very bad in the bottom, go not ſo deep, it will be better to ſet them ſhallow, and raiſe the Earth about them. Try by ſetting the Tree in the hole which ſide will ſtand beſt to the Wall, and then cut off ſuch Branches as grow directly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and fromward the Wall, leaving
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:154132:61"/>only the ſide-Branches to be nail'd unto it; then clap your Tree in, placing it as far from the Wall as the top will allow, that muſt be ſpread upon it, that the Roots may have the more liberty to ſpread towards the Wall, fill up the hole with the Mold, and obſerve the Directions given at <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. <hi>Sect.</hi> 10. and 11. about ſetting Trees in all other things.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Summer pruning of Wall-trees.</note>§. 2. Every year it will be neceſſary to Prune and nail them to the Wall, twice or thrice according as they grow more or leſs; Firſt in Summer about the end of <hi>June</hi> or middle of <hi>July.</hi> Cut off ſuch as grow directly out-ward cloſe to the body; if you cut a part of any Branch off, do it at a Bud, that the Cut may be cover'd with a freſh Sprig; ſome muſt be Cut off, and others ſpread to the Wall; Cut off thoſe that will not ſpread to the Wall, and pluck not off the Leaves of the others.</p>
                     <p>Cutting off the ſmall Branches in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, is ſome check to the Sap, and hinders its exceſſive riſing at that time, which elſe would ſpend it ſelf in larg and ſuperfluous Branches, and ſo rob the fruit.</p>
                     <p>Lay none a croſs or under one another, but let them ſpread as the fingers of your hand when expanded.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The Winter Pruning.</note>§. 3. The Winter Pruning may be done as ſoon as the Leaves and Fruit are fallen,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:154132:61"/>or any time before <hi>February,</hi> except Necta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin's and Peaches, which are apt to dye if Prun'd before the Sap riſe; the beſt time to Prune them is after they Flower.</p>
                     <p>The Winter Pruning is chiefly for the well ordering of the Branches, that could not be well placed in Summer time, and for the Cutting off great Branches when need is. Preſerve Branches as low, and as near the Ground as may be, and cauſe them to bend and grow ſtraight along the ſides of the Wall both ways, and ſuffer not the biggeſt Branches to riſe ſtraight upward, but nail them down-wards, to furniſh the bottom of the Wall. Be ſure to take off thoſe that grow the ſtraighteſt out, and will not be bowed cloſe to the Wall. And Obſerve to bend down the ſtrongeſt Shoots (that would grow upwards) towards the ſides, otherwiſe they will be apt to run ſtraight upward and not cover the ſpace you deſign for them, and by their Luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous growth will extreamly rob the ſide-Branches of their nouriſhment; there will Branches enough ſpring out freſh to run upwards out of them, when they are ſo bowed.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe that ſuffer all the young and larg Shoots, to grow as much as they will all Summer, without Cutting, and then in Winter Cut all or moſt of them quite off from the Trees, and preſerve only the old ſtumps, or biggeſt Branches of the Tree,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:154132:62"/>do commit a great errour; becauſe thereby in the middle part of the Tree, and near the Root, few or no young Branches will be ſeen, whereas they ſhould preſerve all the young Branches to ſpread up againſt the Wall untill it be full of ſmall Boughs, and then ſome young Shoots every year may be Cut off.</p>
                     <p>Shreads of Woollen Cloath are the beſt things to nail them up with; ſome uſe gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Leather, or the Cuttings of any old Hat, any of theſe may ſerve the turn.</p>

                        <note place="margin">To renew Old Trees</note>§. 4. When your Wall-Trees are grown old and full of big Wood, you may in three or four years time renew them, by Cutting out ſome of the biggeſt Stems or Boughs yearly, cutting each Branch off at ſome ſmall twig (if it may be) that either it, or a freſh Branch may grow over the cut place, which muſt be kept cover'd with Clay, and ſo go on yearly till all the big Wood is cut out. Or if you diſlike the kind of Fruit, you may Inoculate or Graft the Boughs with a better ſort of Fruit, but not all in one year, but ſome in one year, and ſome in another.</p>
                     <p>By either of theſe ways you may renew a decaying Tree, and keep your Wall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſtill furniſhed, with leſs trouble and charge, or loſs of Time, than by taking up the old one, and Planting a young one in its ſtead.</p>

In furniſhing your Walls with Fruit-Trees, Obſerve always to Plant Peaches and Nectarines up to the Wall that is moſt Southward; the Eaſt-Wall is to be allotted to Apricocks, early Cherries, and the choiceſt Plums; the Weſt may be ſet with Pears, Cherries, and Plums. Some of the courſeſt Pears and Plums, you may ſet to the North-Wall, both to cover the Wall handſomely, and many years they will bear as well on it, as on Standards; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if your Wall ſtand not directly North, but ſo as to have ſome conſiderable benefit of the Sun, Nut-Trees likewiſe are proper for this Wall, and will proſper well up to it.</p>
                     <p>If your conveniencies will allow it, and you are to build a new Wall, it is much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to have your Garden Walls not ſtand directly towards the four points, than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, and then the worſt Wall will be much better, and the beſt good enough for your purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>As thus, the Eaſt-Wall to incline to the South; the South-Wall to the Weſt, the Weſt-Wall to the North; the North to the Eaſt; or contrary, but not ſo well: In the firſt way the two firſt Walls will be extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary good, and the two later good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for Ordinary Fruit.</p>

                        <note place="margin">How to build a new Wall for Fruit-trees.</note>§. 6. In building a new Wall it would be very advantagious to make it with half-Rounds, each ſemicricle being eight yards round in the inſide, and about ſix yards in

                     <p>One in a cold Countrey having his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-Walls thus made, had his Trees bear Fruit plentifully in ſuch years as his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours generally fail.</p>

                     <p>§. 1. DWarf-Trees have been of late more than ordinarily valued and coveted; becauſe they are of great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage for Table-Fruit (whether Pears, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Plums, or Cherries) and being but of low Statute may be conveniently Planted for Walks, and in the border of Garden-Walks, without prejudicing any thing elſe about them, and their Fruit will be as well ſecured, and commodious for gathering as the Wall-fruit.</p>

                     <p>The Quince-tree is generally uſed, and beſt for Stocks for Pears both for Dwarfs and Wall, as well becauſe it may poſſibly ſomewhat meliorate the Pear as (and that chiefly) becauſe it groweth not to that big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as on a Pear-ſtock it would be apt to do.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Stocks for Dwarf Apple-trees.</note>§. 3. For Dwarf Apple-Trees the beſt Stocks are ſuch as are raiſed of the Cuttings of other Apple-Trees that will grow by Cuttings, as of the Gennet-Moil, Kentiſh-Codling and others.</p>
                     <p>That theſe are more proper for Dwarf-trees than Crabſtocks appears.
<list>
                           <item>1. Becauſe the Fruit will be rather better'd and not tainted with any aſperity or Roughneſs, as poſſibly it might be, if Crabſtocks were made uſe of; and one chief deſign in theſe Trees is to have choice and delicious Fruit for eating.</item>
                           <item>2. Apple-Trees that are raiſed on ſuch Stocks will not grow ſo big as thoſe on Crabſtocks, but are with eaſe and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty kept Dwarfs. Mr. <hi>Rea</hi> judging the Paradiſe-Apple of ſomewhat ſlow growth in bringing forward a Cyen, adviſes to Graff a Paradiſe on a Crabſtock, and the Fruit you would have, on that Paradiſe, that the Crab might yield plenty of Juice or Sap to the Paradiſe, and the Paradiſe retard the growth of the Apple Planted on it, ſo as to keep it a Dwarf; but beſides loſs of time the ſucceſs of this is doubted, becauſe the Crab will put forth ſtrong Roots, and yield plenty of nouriſhment; for why Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-Trees raiſed of Cuttings grow not to be very large Trees, is their putting forth ſuch ſmall Roots, by which means the Tree hath Sap conveyed to it accordingly.</item>
                           <item>3. By uſing theſe Cuttings for Stocks you ſhall get at leaſt four years time, reckoning from
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:154132:65"/>Sowing the Crab-Kernel, and the ſetting the Stem or Cutting be duly conſider'd, as by ſetting the Stem in the place you intend the Dwarf-Tree ſhall grow, and ſetting it in good Earth, for then after one years growth, you may Graft it, and you will eaſily diſcern the advantage in point of time.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>If it be ſaid Crab-ſtocks ready grown may be made uſe of inſtead of Cuttings, There's readily anſwer'd, they muſt grow two, if not three years after they are ſet before they are fit to Graft, and in reſpect of their large growth will not be fit for Dwarfs.</p>
                     <p>Some Nurſery-men have made advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to themſelves by this ſpeedy way of raiſing Trees by Cuttings, but to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage of them they put them off to, for Planting in Orchards; becauſe they are never like to make large or long-laſting-Trees.</p>
                     <p>§. 4. The way then to provide Stocks for Apple-Dwarfs is thus;</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">How to provide Stocks for Apple-Dwarfs.</note>In <hi>October</hi> from ſuch Trees whoſe Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings will grow, take ſuch Stems, or Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that grow ſtraighteſt, and which (in the place where they ſhall be Grafted) are an Inch or more thick, if they be near two Inches ſo much the better; Cut them off if you can, an hands breadth below ſuch Knots or Burs as are on them (for at thoſe Burs
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:154132:65"/>they principally put forth their Roots) and cut off the top that they be not above a yard long, (if you cannot get them ſo long) of Quinces, you muſt be content with ſhorter, if they be two foot it may do reaſonable well; Cut off alſo all the ſide-Branches cloſe to the body, except one ſmall Twig near to the top, for the Sap to vent it ſelf at; ſet theſe preſently in Beds as your Seed-plants were, or rather if your Garden be laid out, (that you can know the places they ſhall ſtand in) ſet them there.</p>
                     <p>You need not fear ſetting theſe as deep as the length will bear, ſo that there be of them about a Foot above Ground, becauſe they will ſhoot out Roots all along, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to the top of the Ground, and ſo ſpread their Roots in the good Soil, and by ſetting them ſomething deep, they are in leſs danger of Dying, and this prevents the trouble of covering the Ground about them with Fern or Straw; and by this means likewiſe they will ſtand the firmer in the looſe Garden-land for Grafting at a years end, and better ſupport a ſpreading top af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Stocks by Circumpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</note>§. 5. But becauſe its hard to meet with great plenty of ſuch Branches, thus to be cut and ſet for Stocks, that have Burs or knots on them; Planters have therefore found out a way (which is called Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition) to bring theſe knots or Burs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:154132:66"/>Branches, that had them not before, and to mend and improve thoſe that before had them, and the way of it is as followeth.</p>
                     <p>About the beginning of <hi>February</hi> next before you deſign to cut theſe Stems, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly above the place you intend to cut them off at, for above a Foot in length, faſten about them ſome Earth in an Old Hat, or Boot, or Bag made of ſome ſtrong Cloth: and in that Earth they will have put forth Roots againſt the <hi>Octob.</hi> following, when you are to cut them off to ſet them.</p>
                     <p>Or (which is a quicker and readier way) you may dawb ſome wet Earth or Clay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the place, and wrap a Hay-band a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, putting ſome moiſt Earth likewiſe betwixt the rounds of the Band, and then running it about again over the ſpaces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt thoſe firſt rounds of the Hay-band, and making faſt the ends of it.</p>
                     <p>If the Stem have no Bur, before you go either of theſe ways to work, then take off here and there a little ſlice of Bark, about an Inch long round about it, near the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the place to be cover'd, as hath been directed.</p>
                     <p>Some direct that before this applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Earth, about an Inch breadth of the Bark be taken off round about the part of the Branch, that is to be ſurrounded with the Earth, that Roots may ſhoot out in greater quantity, by coming out in the upper skirts of that Circle, as well as in the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:154132:66"/>lower; but this is but a Crotchet, and grounded (as my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> and others have obſerved) upon the opinion of deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Sap; whereas indeed there is no ſuch thing; for the whole maſs of Sap is always aſcending, but in leſſer quantity in the Winter; becauſe the Tree is then only to be nouriſhed, and kept alive, to which end a ſmall ſupply is ſufficient, and yet neceſſary; and in greater plenty in the Summer to furniſh the Tree with Leaves, Fruit, and new yearly growth; and the true reaſon why Leaves and Fruit fall off towards Winter, is not becauſe the Sap re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns downward from them, but becauſe the Sap aſcends not ſo vigorouſly at Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as in the Summer, by reaſon of the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Seaſon, and the Suns ſmall ſtay on our Horizon, and becauſe they have arrived to their full ripeneſs, and the Trees fail by degrees to convey up ſo much Sap as it did in the Summer to them, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce freſh ones; and therefore conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that's an idle miſtake too, to think that the Sap or Juice in the Winter, is laid up in the Roots, as a Repoſitory, as appears plainly, inaſmuch as they are ever found dryer in the Winter than in the Summer, ſo that upon the whole, this taking the Bark off round the Branch is good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but to endanger it by intercepting the Juice or Sap, which riſes in greateſt quantity betwixt the Bark and the Wood;
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:154132:67"/>but if as before was hinted, you take ſome little ſlices of the Bark off round the Branch, here and there, leaving the Bark entire in ſome places, this may by checking the Sap, cauſe it the more abundantly paſs and be converted into Roots.</p>
                     <p>But to proceed to the buſineſs in hand, you have ſeen the way of preparing Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings by Circumpoſition; and though ſome will pretend to raiſe Trees of any kind by the uſe of it, yet it's certain it avails not, but only in ſuch as by a peculiar property are apt to put forth Roots, being cut off and ſet into the Ground, and thoſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally known and made uſe of this way, are the Kentiſh Codling, the Gennet-Moil, ſome ſorts of ſweet Apples, and Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweets, the Quince-tree, the Mulberry-tree, Goodsberry-trees, Curran-trees, and the Paradiſe Apple-tree, which laſt is much commended by Mr. <hi>Rea,</hi> for to raiſe Stcocks for Dwarf Apple-trees.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">To raiſe Stocks by cutting down an old Tree.</note>§. 6. Another way to raiſe Stocks for Dwarf-trees is, to cut down ſome one Tree of little worth, of ſuch a kind as you want Stocks of, about a Foot or more from the ground: This will make ſome kind of Trees very apt to caſt forth very good Suckers from the old Roots; ſuch as are of two years growth may be tranſplanted; and the ſtump above ground, will alſo put forth abundance of young Shoots: after
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:154132:67"/>theſe young Shoots have grown out of the Stump one year, caſt Mold or Earth about them a good height, ſo that you cover not the Tops of any of them, where let them grow two years more, and they will be well rooted, then cut them off from the old Stock (which after that may yield freſh ones again) and ſet the Shoots you take off as before hath been directed about Cuttings.</p>
                     <p>Theſe will be about three years longer before they be ready to Graft than Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, but will be very good young freſh Stocks, and is a good way to raiſe Stocks of the Quince-tree for Pears, becauſe Quince-trees generally grow ſo crooked and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, that its difficult to procure any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable quantity of them by Cuttings.</p>
                     <p>If they ſhoot up tall after they are mold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, you had beſt top them at a convenient height; it will make them grow the more in bigneſs and ſo be ſooner fit to Graft. But if you have a deſire to have any of the ſame kind as the old Tree was, you need not top them.</p>
                     <p>And by this means if you want Quince-trees, Codlings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you may be furniſhed with plenty, that will make better and handſomer Trees than if you raiſe them by Cuttings.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Stocks for Dwarf Pear-trees.</note>§. 7. You may raiſe Stocks for Dwarf Pear-trees from Suckers of Old Pear-trees (if you cannot conveniently get enough of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:154132:68"/>the Quince-tree) for many Pear-trees caſt them naturally, which being preſerved from Cattle, may be taken up and ſet in Beds of Earth as you did the Seedlings.</p>
                     <p>If your Pear-trees yield not Suckers of themſelves, you need only cut off the top of ſome old ill Pear-tree (and Graff it with a better Fruit if you pleaſe) and the Roots will caſt forth Suckers plentifully, and you may help them by making a ſmall Ditch or Gutter ſo as to bear ſome of the Roots a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two yards diſtant from the Tree, or pare off the Graſs (if any grow about the Tree) that they may have the more liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſpring up.</p>
                     <p>Or in this caſe you may bare the Roots, and then give a Cut croſs ſome Roots al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to the Heart, and from the croſs Cut cleave the Root, raiſing up the looſe part, and put in a little Stone to keep it open; cover it three Inches over with Mold; let this be done if you can, where you find a Bud or Eye on the Root for the Sucker to Shoot out at, and either inoculate the young Shoot in the place where it ſtands, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it to ſome other place after a years growth, and when you do, cut off with it about a Foot of the old Root; and by this means you may have Suckers from ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Trees, that do not naturally yield them.</p>

To have Stocks for Dwarf Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and Plums, or for ſuch Trees for a Wall, the ſpeedieſt way, and ſuch as will ſucceed for that purpoſe, is by Suckers of the common red Cherry, and any ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or rather white Plum-tree, both which caſt up Suckers plentifully.</p>
                     <p>If the Suckers grow in a place ſecure from harm, you may inoculate, or Graft them before removal, under their mother Plant, and let them grow there one year after: and thereby you'l gain a years time and more; and chooſe ſuch Suckers as grow at greateſt diſtance from the old Tree.</p>

In Grafting or inoculating Stocks for Dwarf-trees, obſerve to do it as low as you well can, with two Cyens placed on each Stock, and thoſe longer than in Graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for large Standards that they may ſpread from the Ground.</p>
                     <p>And after they are grown two or three years in the places they are to ſtand in, to make them ſpread, and to keep the Boughs outward, you may tye an old Hoop of a Barrel, or ſome ſuch thing in the midd'ſt of the Branches, to bear them a good diſtance one from another; but if one Branch be much ſtronger, or more inclined to grow upright than the reſt, then you
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:154132:69"/>may drive a Stake into the Ground, and tye the ſturdy one down to it.</p>
                     <p>If you Cut the Bark croſſwiſe in ſeveral places on the inſide of the Branches, when they are placed as you would have them, it will be a means to make them more willing to continue in that order of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, after ſome years growth: If any one Branch ſhoot out much further than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, cut off its top to keep it even with the reſt, and yearly cut much off, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally new Shoots, that grow directly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, after they are grown to that height you deſign them to be of,<note place="margin">Trees rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</note> which may be about a yard and an half.</p>
                     <p>§. 10. Having directed how to raiſe Kentiſh-Codlings, Gennet-Moils, Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or any that grow of Cuttings for Stocks; there needs no other Rules for raiſing Trees, or Hedges of the ſame kind of Fruit, only you need not cut them ſo ſhort as you do for Stocks.</p>
                     <p>Codlings Grafted on Crab-ſtocks, and ſet in a Garden or elſewhere will, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their growth; becauſe Crab-ſtocks have great Roots, and will yield them more plenty of nouriſhment than Roots of their own putting forth, when they are raiſed only of Cuttings. Others
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:154132:69"/>Graft Gennet-Moils on Crab-ſtocks, and they thrive well, and bear a larger and (ſome think) a better Fruit than thoſe Trees of that kind raiſed by Cuttings: ſome have Grafted ſeveral of them in rough and Woody Grounds, which have grown with very ſtrong Shoots, and cover'd the Stocks very ſoon.</p>

                     <p>§. 1. MUltitudes of Fruit-trees may be Planted abroad in the Fields and Hedges of incloſed Grounds, whereof very great profit may be made without any conſiderable damage either to Corn, Hay, or Paſture, and its beſt in this way to Plant the courſer, harder, and long-keeping kinds of Fruits, which will not be meanly ſerviceable to a Family by uſing them ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Baking or Cyder. Theſe Trees being about ſeven Foot high before they begin to ſpread, will be out of the reach of Cattle, and not troubleſome to Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men about Hay and Corn in Summer-time, if Planted twenty or thirty Yards diſtant one from another, and in Ranks through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Field, that the Plow may continue a ſtraight Furrow all along from one end to the other, whereby Corn will grow near the Roots of ſuch Trees almoſt as good as any where in the Field, and Graſs as much or more under Trees as where none are,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:154132:70"/>tho not altogether ſo ſweet, by reaſon of the droppings, yet the multitude of Fruit abundantly compenſates the damage almoſt Ten-fold.</p>
                     <p>Many Countries in <hi>England</hi> have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced the benefit of Planting in the Fields, where it hath been of long and general uſage, and in many other Countries Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen have begun already to imitate them, which ſhould much encourage others to follow; for the more there are that Plant, the leſs particular perſons will loſe by Thieves, and where Fruit is in great plean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it is found to be more ſlighted by Idle people; and beſides if a man hath ſtore, hee'l not feel the loſs of a little, or it may quit his coſt, to have one to caſt an Eye to them, for a months time near ripening; and further yet Cyder-Apples, Baking-Pears, and Pears for Perry are ſo little grateful to the Taſt (which Pilferers chiefly aim at pleaſing) that he that taſts them once, ſhall ſcarcely find his Teeth water after them a ſecond time. However the benefit of Planting in Fields much out-weighs theſe and all other incoveniences; for by this means you may have a double Crop on your Lands, <hi>viz.</hi> Graſs or Corn, and your Fruit, and the Land rather bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitted (as the matter may be ordered) than damaged; One of theſe Trees alſo bears as much Fruit as three of the beſt in a thick-planted Orchard, the benefit
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:154132:71"/>whereof for Sale or uſe in a Family for Bak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or Liquors, or other uſes, is known to be ſo very conſiderable, that it's needleſs to ſay more of it.</p>

If your Land be in tillage, you may ſet Fruit-trees at thirty Yards diſtance from one another,<note place="margin">How to Plantwhole Fields.</note> throughout the whole Fields, in ſtraight and direct Rows, after the manner of an Orchard, and you may go on with your Plowing with the loſs on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of about a yard, or four Foot Square of Land about every Tree for twenty years at leaſt, and when they are grown ſo big, that you think your Corn receives hurt by the ſhade or droppings of the Trees, if you can turn it to paſture, the Trees will improve moſt kind of Land, by keeping it warm in the Spring, they will make the Graſs come and grow more early, and by Shades in the Summer preſerve it from burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but the Trees being ſet at ſuch a diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, the Land may continue for any purpoſe for ever, if you dreſs or Prune theſe Trees higher up than any other, that no Boughs may hang in the reach of Cattle, and for convenience of going about them with your Team to any work, and thereby the Air and Rain will have free acceſs to the Graſs, or Grain near about them, and the Fruit will be ſafer from common Pilferers. Theſe need no other fencing than Thorns bound about them, and a Stake driven in the midſt to keep them from ſhaking; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you may receive the proſit of the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:154132:72"/>Stubble or Fallow without ſuffering any large Cattle to come into the Ground, that will browſe upon them.</p>
                     <p>§. 4. Another way of Planting Fruit-trees in Fields is by ſetting Walks of them,<note place="margin">How to Plant Walks of Fruit-trees in Fields.</note> running through the midſt, or along the ſides of your Paſture-grounds, where you have a mind to have Walks for ornament, or ſhady: for why Walks of Fruit-trees ſhould not be rather Planted than of Elm, Sycamores, Aſh-trees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> none can pretend a reaſon, there being ſome ſorts of Fruit-trees that will (and almoſt any kind may be ordered ſo as to) grow very handſome in ſhape, beſides the beauty and ſweet ſmell of the Bloſſoms, and worth of the Fruit.</p>
                     <p>To prevent damage by Cattle, if you go this way to work in Field Planting, they muſt be well grown before you ſet them, that is, they muſt be of about ſix years growth, and then well fenced, and there are two ways uſed to ſave them harmleſs. 1. One much commended is by Tumping them,<note place="margin">To ſet Trees by Tumping.</note> and it's performed thus, <hi>viz.</hi> ſet your Trees in the place deſigned on the top, or almoſt on the top of the Ground, no deeper than to make it ſtand, tho all the Roots be not cover'd, till the Tump or Mound be raiſed about it; and then take a line about a yard and quarter long, tye the one end of it about the Tree, but ſo
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:154132:72"/>that in going round the Tree with the Line ſtrain'd, it may ſlip about the Tree as you go; faſten the other end to an Iron ſetter or ſtick with a ſharp point, and as you go round the Tree, mark the Ground; Make then a Ditch on the out-ſide of the round Score, and lay the Turf handſomly two or three heights, with the Graſs-ſide outward ſo as to make the work full half a yard, or two Foot high; then caſt the Mold out of the Ditch, obſerving to throw the beſt of it next the Roots of the Tree, till you have raiſed it within as high as the Turf; then prick ſtrong Thorns into the Mold, that they may lye upon the Turf, and point outwards a yard over the Turf; as you place the Thorns, put more Turf or faſt heavy Earth out of the Ditch upon the ends of them, treading it down the better to fix them, and lay the Earth ſhelving down from the Turf towards the Tree, that if Rain fall it may ſoke towards the Roots; if you have any ſmall Thorns, Bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars, Furs, or Gorſe, lay it one the top of the work finiſhed, round the Tree and repair all yearly as you ſee cauſe, which may be done with ſmall trouble. The following obſervations will demonſtrate the great convenience of ſetting Fruit-trees this way.</p>
                     <p>Firſt if your Land be over moiſt this Ditch will drain all wet from the Roots of the Tree; but if the Land be Clay or
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:154132:73"/>ſuch that the Water will ſtand in, then when you perceive it (which is very rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) cut ſome little Notch or Trench to let it out.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, This way of ſetting is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in dry Land; becauſe the Earth of the Mound will ſecure the Roots from the heat of the Sun, and every ſhower of Rain will much refreſh it, by ſoaking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Tree.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, You need not bind your Tree to a ſtake which doth often gall and Hurt the Tree, for ſo much Earth about it will keep it ſteady,</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, If your Land be ſtiff, or ſtrong old Land, the Mound made of it will mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and improve about the Roots, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by that time the Roots ſpread as far as the Ditch, it will be fill'd up with Mold fallen from the Tump, and with ſticks, Leaves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which will be rotten, looſe, and good for Trees to Root in, and by that time they will need little or no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, if any at all; A few Thorns tyed about the bodies of the Trees, to keep Cattle from rubbing againſt them will be enough.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, The Chief benefit of ſetting Trees thus, is, that where the Soil is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what too moiſt or ſhallow, the Tree being ſet on the top of the Land, will put forth it's Roots plentifully into the Earth caſt
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:154132:73"/>up, and thence ſhoot into the upper Turf and beſt Land that hath been Plowed and manured before.</p>
                     <p>Another way of Fencing is, by erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a Foot and a half diſtance one from another, about every Tree three ſmall Poſts, (if they be ſawed they need be but three Inches ſquare) or you may uſe Poles, or ſtraight Boughs, either whole, or if big enough, cloven in two, three or four parts, about five Foot above the Ground in height, being driven into the Ground, nail a croſs Bar of Wood from each to other, within a Hand's breadth of the tops of the Poſts, to which Bar, nail a Pale or two betwixt each two Poſts, ſtuck into the Ground or nail'd to the like Croſs Bat within a Foot of the bottom of the Poſts; the way of it may be ſeen now in diverſe places, and learn't in a Minute; though what's ſaid here makes it plain enough.</p>
                     <p>This way is more chargable than Tump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, where Timber is ſcarce, but much more dureable than it, and abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary where Deer, or Rabbets, or any thing that peels the Bark off, come into the Land Planted.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Planting near Hedg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in the Fields.</note>§. 5. Another way of Planting in Fields which hath been ſucceſsfully Practiſed, is thus; When you ſcour a Ditch, and cut down or plaiſh an old Quickſet-Hedg, then ſet a row of Trees within a yard of the Hedg
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:154132:74"/>on that ſide that is not Ditch't, and Fence them with half-Round Tumps only on the one ſide, for the Hedg will ſecure them on the other, and from the cut or plaiſh't Hedg, you will commonly have Thorns and Bryars enough for the Mounds, to Fence it as hath been before directed; and at the ſame time, or in Summer, draw ſome of the Quickthorns, Hips, or Bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars, from the Hedg in o the Fence, about the Tump which will contribute to the ſtrengthening and preſerving the dead fence you had made about it before; ſo that you may be free from trouble about it for ever after.</p>
                     <p>There are theſe advantages in this way of Planting, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. The Ditch on the out-ſide the Hedg drains the Ground and makes it healthful and ſound.</item>
                        <item>2. The Ground near the Hedg is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly very Rich, as not having been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſhed by Tillage, but improved ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by the often ſcouring of the Ditch, and commonly with the Dung of Cattle, that for ſhelter, Shade or Fodder repair thither.</item>
                        <item>3. Its not the leaſt hindrance to Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Graſs; for the Hedg when its grown up, uſually beareth out as far as the Tree is ſet in the Field.</item>
                        <item>4. And this is much better than Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Hedg Row, as many do; for in
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:154132:74"/>a large top its apter to weaken the Hedg under it, but theſe being ſet a little diſtance from the Hedg, and growing (as they will) with the greateſt part of their Heads from it, will not damage it.</item>
                        <item>5. The Fruit may be gathered with much more eaſe, than of thoſe that are Planted in the Hedges.</item>
                        <item>6. They will not be choak't or hurt by the Hedg when its grown up, but be good handſome fair Trees.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>You may ſet theſe at eight yards diſtance, or nearer, being but one ſingle Row, and ſo if but half a Field (as uſually it falls out) have the Ditch on the out-ſide, you may ſet a conſiderable number, and find advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage without damage, and with inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable charge, eſpecially if the Ditch ſtand on the North-ſide, if you can, therefore chooſe ſuch Hedges.</p>
                     <p>This is not to be practiſed near Hedges that are full of great Wood, or Trees; but if there be but few Trees, its but leaving a vacancy near ſuch Trees, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting your Fruit-trees againſt ſuch places, where there grow none in the Hedg.</p>

                        <note place="margin">How to Plant in Hedges is the Fields.</note>§. 6. Another way of Planting in Fields is this, if you would Plant without any charge of Fencing, you may do it in your Hedges; theſe Trees muſt be well grown and ſtrong, that the Hedg choak them not while they are young: and when you
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:154132:75"/>plaiſh or cut down a Quick Hedg, obſerve no certain diſtance, but as it happens where you find it moſt free from Quick, ſet a Tree and incloſe the Body in the Hedg, but bind not the Etherings too cloſe about it, leſt they gall and fret it, and as it groweth obſerve what Thorns annoy it, and cut them off.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Planting by the Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of Gennet-Moils, &amp;c.</note>§. 7. If you have a mind to ſet any Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of Codlings, Gennet-Moils, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Apple-trees that grow of Cuttings, they will proſper very well in, or rather near a Hedg, becauſe generally there the Mold is looſe and mellow for them to put forth Roots in, and ſomewhat enrich't by the frequent cleanſing of the Ditch; if you Plant them near the Hedg, you muſt a little Fence them on the one ſide, as by the third foregoing direction; but the Tumps you raiſe to ſet the Thorns in, muſt not be above a Foot high, for the Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings will ſhoot out their Roots, almoſt to the top of the Earth about them, and a high Mound falling down by degrees, ſome of the beſt Roots may be left bare, or very little Earth upon them.</p>
                     <p>The way of preparing Plants for this purpoſe, is by Circumpoſition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as is directed in the 11 <hi>Chap.</hi> of Dwarf-trees.</p>
                     <p>Make choice of Cuttings or Stems as big as a Mans wriſt (if you can) towards the lower end; before you ſet them, prune
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:154132:75"/>them out of the reach of Cattle, and leave but little top on them when you ſet them, neither let them be very long; if the tops be out of the reach of the Cattle its e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Planting in Fields by long Crab-tree Stocks.</note>§. 8. There be ſome that get long Crab-tree-ſtocks out of Woods, or elſe dreſs ſome up in their Nurſeries to grow tall, and ſet them in their Fields or Hedges, and at three years ſtanding Graft them, which may do well and is better approved of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there needs no removal after they are Grafted (which is of great advantage as to make both good-bearing and ſound Trees) but ſome inconvenience there is in this way: the long Stocks out of Woods being commonly very old, their Bark thick, their Roots big, they thrive but indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently; and thoſe raiſed in Nurſeries will ſeldom be taper grown, or ſtrong enough to bear a large top well, after they are Grafted ſo high as they ought, being ſet in Fields: You will alſo be longer in raiſing Stocks to that height, and any conſiderable ſtrength (as is neceſſary for this purpoſe) than in raiſing Trees, if your Stocks be Grafted young in your Nurſery, becauſe they thrive more after Grafting than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and in both Caſes if you Graft them high, the Stocks will be continually put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out ſprouts of their own kind below the place they are Grafted at, which will
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:154132:76"/>require frequent cutting off; if you Graft them not very high you will find it difficult to defend them from the nipping of Cattle, and from the Cyens being broke out of the Stocks by ſome caſualties or other, to which they are more expoſed in Fields that lye common to Cattle, than Nurſeries that are incloſed.</p>

The way moſt uſed in Planting-Countries is by Grafting ſuch Crab-trees as grow in the Hedges or Grounds, and this is the ſpeedieſt way to have Fruit; becauſe the big Trees have Bodies already, and in four or five years time (well ordered) will have good tops to bear; and if you Graft ſmall Stocks in your Ground that have grown of their own accord there, and Fence them, they will ſpeedily bring on Grafts, being ſo well Rooted.</p>

                           </gap>f of Grafting the bodies of old Trees.</note>§. 10. Many cut off the tops of old Crab-trees, or Apple-trees, and Graft the body or Trunk, but the Cyens could never cover the Heads of thoſe Stocks, and by that time the top was a little grown up, the body was ready to periſh with rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The beſt way for big Crabtrees (or if you would change the kind of any Fruit-trees) is to Graft them in the Boughs, where they are not bigger than a Mans Arm, making uſe of none but thoſe that grow handſome at convenient diſtance one from
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:154132:76"/>another, cutting off the others ſmooth and even, cloſe to the Body of the Tree.</p>
                     <p>To do this, that Winter that you cut or plaiſh a Hedg, order the Workmen to trim up, but not to lop or top the Crab-trees, unleſs it be the tops of the Boughs two Foot above the place you intend to Graft them at, and then in <hi>March</hi> following ſaw off the Heads at proper places and Graft them.</p>

Many are for Grafting theſe in the Cleft; becauſe they think the Cyen hath beſt hold, and will not be ſo ſubject to be broke off, or out, by the Wind, as thoſe Grafted in the Bark; but many times thoſe in the Cleft are broke out by the Wind, neither can you perceive that the Wood of the Cyen in the Cleft did ever cement with the Wood of the Stock, but only on the outſide as the others do: And thoſe in the Cleft are not ſo apt to grow all of them, nor to make ſo great a growth as thoſe in the Bark, which with a little wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs may be preſerved from danger of the Wind, and full as much care muſt be had about thoſe Grafted in the Cleft, if you will preſerve them all from the ſame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice.</p>

                        <note place="margin">How to Graft old Trees.</note>§. 12. You may obſerve the following difference in Grafting theſe great Foughs from all the forementioned varieties of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:154132:77"/>Grafting, and look upon it as a thing well worthy to be taken notice of and obſerved.</p>
                     <p>When you have prepared the Cyen as you are directed to do when you Graft in the Bark, apply it to the place you deſign to put it in, and ſlit the Bark of the Bough through on both ſides the Cyen cloſe to it, beginning at the top of the Bough, and not carrying the ſlits much above half length of the ſlope of the Cyen, ſeparate that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle portion of the Bark between the two ſlits, from the Wood with your Inſtrument, thruſting it a little lower than the ſlits, to let in the Cyen as far as it is ſloped, and then ſtick the Cyen in, having firſt taken off from the edges of the Cyen any uneven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (not cutting through the Bark) that all may the better fit together, and you may put in two, three, or four Cyens in every head, having reſpect to the bigneſs of it; or you may in the biggeſt put in two Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens in the Cleft, and two others in the Bark, doing one of the later on the Weſt-ſide of it, for then the Wind blowing it towards the Head, is not ſo apt to break it out, as if it drove it from the head; bind the heads and Clay them as you heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and continue to do ſo yearly till the heads are almoſt covered.</p>
                     <p>At firſt Claying, ſtick in Feathers or long Eſcures, to prevent Birds lighting on the Cyens.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>July</hi> following (whether you Graft
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:154132:77"/>theſe big Stocks in the Cleft or Bark) pick off moſt of the Leaves of the Cyens, and cut off ſuch ſprigs as growing inward will make the head thick, and all ſtragling out Boughs, that the Wind may not have ſo much force upon them to break the Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches out of the Stocks.</p>
                     <p>Cut off alſo ſome of the biggeſt Shoots the Crab-tree puts forth of its own kind; but for the firſt three years, you muſt not cut off all, left the Tree not having liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to vent all the Sap that cometh up, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit and dye, the ſmall Grafts not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to receive near ſo much Sap as the old top did the year before.</p>
                     <p>Thus many Country-men when they take off the head of an old Oak, have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times found it dye, and therefore in ſome Countries, they leave one big Bough to grow for one year to draw up the Sap, (as they term it) whereas it is indeed that the Sap may have liberty to vent it ſelf; for Trees that have a thick Bark, as old Oaks have, when all the ſmall Boughs are cut off, are long in putting forth Branches; and difficulty at laſt put forth ſo many as will ſpend the Sap which comes up the Tree, in ſome proportion to what it did the year before, when the whole top was on, which Sap being chiefly in the greateſt Channel betwixt or near the Bark and out-ſide of the Body of the Tree, and not being ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is either dryed or conſumed by the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:154132:78"/>heat of the Sun, or putrifies for want of that continual motion that is in it, when it hath vent, that ſeveral Trees dye of this Diſeaſe; and when Trees dye this way the Bark will drop off from the Body of them ſooner by ſome years than otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>Hence it is that you may kill a Tree, by lopping off the whole top in the Summer time, or ſo much of it that the remaining Boughs cannot receive all the Sap, but it ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth choakt up for want of Iſſue.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Summer you ought to bind ſome Hay-ropes, about the lower part of the Cyens; there will be no great need of repeating this the third Summer, but if done, it will the more certainly ſecure them from breaking by the Wind.</p>
                     <p>Thus you may ſecurely and ſpeedily Graft old Trees, that are either bad Bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or bear Fruit of bad kinds, and they will in three or four years hear plentifully, if you take care (which you always ought to do upon any Grafting or inoculating) to Graft them with kinds that experience of your ſelf, or others, can faithfully aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you to be of very good bearing kinds.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Of Pruning Vines.</note>§. 5. As Vines ſtand in more need of Pruning than other Fruit-trees, ſo great care is to be taken in the performing of it; when you have ſet your Vine as you have been before directed, ſo that not above two Buds of it remain above Ground, you are to nail up ſuch Branches as grow forth up to the Wall, till it have over-ſpread as much Wall as you deſign for it, ſuffering not above two Branches to grow from the Ground, and ſnipping yearly the tops of the Branches a conſiderable length, as far as they are weak and tender, and alſo all ſmall poor ones, cloſe to the body, unleſs the well-liking Branches be but few, and then you may leave the loweſt Bud of ſome of them, to grow forth next year, and this you are to do yearly towards <hi>February,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>January.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When your Vine comes to bear, you are to uſe your Knife about it three times in the year.</p>
                     <p>Firſt at fartheſt in <hi>February,</hi> and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining thereof you are to prune off part of the foregoing years Shoots where they are too thick, cloſe to the old Wood. As it enriches your Vine to keep it thin of Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, ſo you muſt take care it be well ſtored with Buds againſt the Spring fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, for it bears Grapes only on the new Shoots of every year; and in cutting off theſe Branches, you muſt take care your Wall continue furniſhed with ſuch Branches
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:154132:81"/>as may be ſpread upon the Wall regularly and decently, not thick in one place and thin in another, nor croſſing out another. On every Sprig you cut off in this Pruning, where you would have Fruit the ſucceeding year, leave two or three Buds, for out of thoſe Buds, eſpecially the ſecond or third, proceeds the Cluſters; alſo cut off the Branch aſlope on one ſide or under, that the Rain reſt not on the Pith of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining part.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The next time to take off ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluties from your Vine is about Midſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, when the Grapes are knit; clip off then the end of the Branches that have Grapes on them, a little above the Grapes, that they may have the more nouriſhment and keep them nail'd to the Wall, as alſo barren Branches where the Wall needs them.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The laſt time of cutting is in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> for then, becauſe Leaves and Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches may be ſo thick, as to keep the Heat of the Sun from the Grapes, which is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ripen them, you may pluck off ſome of the Leaves, and cut off ſome of the Branches to open way for the Sun to come to them.</p>
                     <p>There's on thing to be obſerved in Prun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe, peculiar to it, that whereas others are cut at a Bud, the Branches of theſe muſt be cut off near the midſt betwixt two Buds, and that not later in the year than the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:154132:81"/>of <hi>February,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Note. that <hi>December</hi> and <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,</hi> are the beſt times for tee Winter Pruning of Vines.</note> for afterwards the Sap or Juice will run out, and the Vine will be much weakened by bleeding. You will by that time alſo ſee what the Froſt of the Winter foregoing hath kill'd, which muſt be taken all away.</p>
                     <p>If Froſts come before any Grapes are ripe, defend them in the night time by Tilts or Mats.</p>
                     <p>§. 6. It's not worth your labour to Plant Vines by Eſpaliers,<note place="margin">Vineyards proſper not in <hi>England.</hi>
                        </note> or in a Vineyard in <hi>England;</hi> becauſe of the early nipping Froſts which our Clymate is very ſubject to, which is the reaſon ti's ſeldom uſed, and the uſage of people in ſuch caſes affords no weak Argument that it's of no advantage; And Grapes ſeldom or never ripen well in this Iſle, without great help of Art and induſtry, to which purpoſe take theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, To Plant ſuch as ripen ſooneſt in the year, that they may have as much of the Summer heat at ripening time as may be.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Let the Wall you Plant them againſt, be a full South, or but a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to the Eaſt; or if you have a half round, or corner in a Wall, or the back of a Brick Chimney, or a Kiln-wall, or Barn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall poſited as aforeſaid, make uſe of ſuch places for them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="146" facs="tcp:154132:82"/>Vines will proſper and bear well againſt a high Wall, yet that is not altogether ſo neceſſary but that low Walls may ſerve turn, and the higher may be reſerved for ſuch Fruit-trees as will not do well with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them. That of a Tarras Walk may do well for Vines, and the Gravel Walk under the Wall mightily encreaſe the heat about them.</p>
                     <p>If you Plant any Trees againſt your dwelling-houſe Wall, there may be ſome narrow places between two windows, or the like, where other Fruit-trees have not room to ſpread: a Vine may grow up there, and above thoſe narrow places enlarge it ſelf where ever it meets with room.</p>
                     <p>You may alſo Plant a Vine betwixt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Fruit-tree that groweth againſt your hotteſt Walls, and let it ſpread a little in the Summer time into the Fruit-trees on either ſide, eſpecially if the Fruit of ſuch Trees uſe to be early ripe, or that they bear little Fruit, or have not been ſo long ſet as to have covered the Wall. And tho ſuch Vines cannot extend themſelves to that bigneſs, as thoſe Planted where they have more room; yet by this means you will make advantage of ſuch portions of your Wall, as otherwiſe you could have but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle benefit from.</p>
                     <p>Some Vines Shoot ſorth exceeding large Branches yearly, but bear little; in ſuch caſes bare the Roots, and cut off a Maſter
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:154132:82"/>Root, or two from the Tree, then lay ſome Sand, Aſhes; or any hot barren Soil to the Roots, and it will abate the redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy of Sap, and conduce to bearing Fruits.</p>
                     <p>§. 7. Do not pull or cut off your Vine-Leaves in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> or <hi>September,</hi> with deſign of giving acceſs to the Suns heat, thereby to acclerate the maturity of the Fruit, as many frequently uſe to do, and as is before directed in <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. for on my own experince, ſuch depriving the Grape of it's Leafed ſhelter from the cool Air, or morning Froſts, hath always proved pernicious and deſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the Grape; and I have often obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the beſt Grapes and earlieſt ripe, to be under the ſhadow and Protection of ſome Leaf.</p>

                     <p>And this is the way of propagating Fruit-trees by Layers:<note place="margin">How to propagate by Layers.</note> And you may here take notice, that all ſuch Trees that may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated by Cuttings, as Currans, Quince, Goosberries, Raſpherries, Barberries, Figs, Vines, Mulberries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed likewiſe by Layers, and this way takes more ſure than by Cuttings. Trees ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally have large Pith that will grow by Cuttings and Layers.</p>
                     <p>Quince-trees delight, and bear beſt in a fat, moiſt, rich Land, where ſome Sinck, or Gutter that carries away the ſoke or Waſh of a Dunghil or Houſe, is a place uſually choſen for them, and is ſuch as they like very well in.</p>
                     <p>Some will Graft or Inoculate Quince-ſtocks, with Grafts or Buds from Quince-trees of good bearing kinds, which will cauſe them to bear more early.</p>

                     <p>MUlberries are diſtinguiſhed by their Colours, for there are Black, Red, and White.</p>
                     <p>The Black Mulberry-tree never fails of Fruit after it's grown up, but the White ſeldom bears well.</p>
                     <p>They are raiſed by Suckers, Layers, or Cuttings from the Branches or ſides of the Tree.</p>
                     <p>Theſe following Trees and Shrubs are very apt to grow of Cuttings or Slips, as Codlings, Gennetings, Brets, Gennet-Moils, Quinces, Goosberries, Currans, Figs, Vines, Tamarisk, Honeyſuckles, and Roſes in ſome Grounds. By Laying, almoſt any ſort of Trees or Shrubs will grow, if a little Inciſion be made, as the beformention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Mulberries, Cornelions, Lime-trees,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:154132:88"/>Gelder-Roſes, Roſes of all ſorts. The Seaſon for ſetting of Cuttings of Trees to grow, is from the full of the Leaf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till Candlemas. The Seaſon to encreaſe Trees by Laying, is from Michaelmas to the beginning of <hi>March,</hi> and ſomtimes in the Spring or Summer.</p>

                     <p>There are two ſorts of Services, one larger than the other, that groweth wild in the Woods, but neither the ſorts of theſe, nor of Medlars, are diſtinguiſhed by names, and the Fruit of both is not eatable till they are rotten.</p>
                     <p>Medlars are raiſed by Grafting on the Pear-tree, Crab-tree, White-thorn, or Service-tree, the laſt is the beſt, and the White-Thorn by much the worſt.</p>

                     <p>There are ſome varieties of Goosberries, the beſt ſorts are the Amber, and great Hedghog Goosberry, which is prickly, but the other ſmooth, both of a bright Yellow colour, and the great White Holland, or Dutch Goosberry, which is large, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, and a great bearer. The great Yellow Dutch Goosberry, differeth from the laſt only in colour. The great early Red Goosberry is a fine, ſharp, pleaſant Fruit, and firſt ripe; there are likewiſe ſome that are Blue, differing little from the former, but late ripe, and the Great Green Goosberry late ripe, but good; and there are ſeveral ſmall Goosberries not worth Planting or taking notice of.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="162" facs="tcp:154132:90"/>§. 2. Currans or Corinths,<note place="margin">Currans.</note> taking their name from <hi>Corinthia</hi> where firſt had. The great White Dutch Curran, and the great Red Dutch Curran, are the faireſt, largeſt and beſt, and the great Yellow Dutch Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran differs only in Colour, all others are to be ejected out of your Gardens; the Engliſh and Black Currans not being worth Planting in compariſon with the White and Red Dutch Currans. The great Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Dutch Curran is largeſt, and hath a ſweet reliſh, and ſince it became a Native of our Soil, is much improved, where Planted in rich moiſt Grounds.</p>
                     <p>§. 3. Of Barberries there is the ordinary,<note place="margin">Barberries.</note> or common ſort, and Barberries without Stones, and the great Barberry, which is a ſort bearing bigger Fruit than either of the other.</p>
                     <p>Of Rasberries there are three ſorts;<note place="margin">Rasberries.</note> The Common Wild; The large Red Garden Rasberry, a pleaſant Fruit, and yields a delicate juice, And the White Rasberry lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle inferior to the Red.</p>
                     <p>Goosberries, Currans, Rasberries, and Barberries are beſt raiſed by Suckers, of which you may have plenty about the Roots of old Trees. And Goosberries, and Currans may be propagated by Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or by Branches, or Shoots cut off and ſet; they are to be ſet four or five Foot diſtant from each other upon Borders, or
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:154132:90"/>Beds of rich moiſt Land: The ſeaſon for Planting them is from Michaelmas to Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlemas.</p>
                     <p>Currans and Rasberries will proſper and like very well in ſhady places, and the colder the Soil, the better will Ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries bear and thrive.</p>
                     <p>Rasberries uſually bear the ſame year they are ſet, if drought, or too late Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hinder not; and that which bears this year, dyes after bearing, and what Springs new this year bears the next; Cut no more of them than what will make them a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle handſome, and in the Winter cut or break out all the dead Stalks from amongſt the living Rasberries.</p>
                     <p>When Currans, Goosberries, and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries have grown ſome years, ſuffer not too many Suckers to grow about them, nor cut the tops to a round cloſe Buſh, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Gardiners do, whereby they grow ſo thick that they neither bear, nor ripen their Fruit ſo well as if the grew taller and thinner.</p>
                     <p>All the ſaid Fruits (<hi>viz.</hi> Goosberries, Currans Barberries and Rasberries) like well in ſhades, tho the Fruits are not of ſo delicate a taſt, as thoſe that grow in the Sun: You ought to keep the Ground a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

                     <p>§. 1. THe Stones of Peaches produce Trees that will bear Peaches, ſomtimes better than the Peaches out of which the Stones were taken, altho thoſe Peaches grew upon a Tree that was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculated on a Plum-ſtock: And therefore ſome Gardiners by ſetting many Stones of the Newington-peach, have found ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Trees come up from them, to bear a Fruit rather improved than worſe, and by giving it a new name, and Inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating from it, have made good gain of it; but this is not a practiſe for every pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſon; becauſe Peach-trees ſo raiſed, will be much longer before they bear Fruit, than thoſe which are Inoculated; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he muſt run the hazard of filling great part of his Wall with theſe Peach-trees thus raiſed from Stones, and not one, it may be, in an hundred prove any thing extraordinary, and the reſt of no uſe, unleſs for Stocks; after he hath waited
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:154132:92"/>ſeveral years to ſee what Fruit they will bear.</p>
                     <p>§. 2. Of Peaches the firſt and ſooneſt ripe is the White Nutmeg, next that is the Red Nutmeg, next to that is the Troy, which is ripe almoſt as ſoon, and a better Fruit; next ripe are.</p>

                     <p>PEars are of very many kinds, in ſo much that ſome have affirm'd that there are no leſs than four or five hundred ſeveral kinds; but however, certain it is there are ſo many, that to trouble the Reader with their names would be very needleſs, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome of the Choiceſt for all uſes will be moſt proper for the ſtoring your Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, eſpecially if you reſpect profit more than curioſity, which is the main deſign of this little Tract.</p>
                     <p>Pears are much improved, as is moſt Fruit by being Planted againſt Walls. In <hi>France</hi> they are accounted among their beſt Fruit, and the beſt kinds well merit it.</p>
                     <p>The Summer and Winter-Bon-Criſtien growing pendent are fitter for a Wall, than to be Planted of Standards; the Winter will keep till <hi>May,</hi> and is a very choice Pear.</p>
                     <p>The Bury de-Roy, is eſteemed for the Table the beſt of all Summer Pears, it's a fair Brown Pear, excellent in it's ſeaſon,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:154132:97"/>melting in the Mouth, thence call'd the Butter-pear, and bears well againſt a Wall; the Green Bury-pear, is more Green, and larger than the former.</p>

THe nature of Soil is the chief cauſe of the Moſs and Canker, and therefore without altering the one, you can ſcarce prevent the other, however you may with a hair cloth rub the Moſs off, after rain, or (as ſome ſay) burn it with a bottle of Straw under the Tree: but if you only ſcrape or rub off the Moſs, in few years they'l be as much annoyed therewith as ever; becauſe Moſſineſs is cauſed by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver coldneſs of the Ground; as in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſh and Clay Grounds, and likewiſe by Barrenneſs of the Soil. If the coldneſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from over much moiſture, lay it dryer, by Trenching the Ground; if Clay Grounds, then mix warmer Soils therewith as you are before taught at <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. <hi>Sect.</hi> 10. yet be ſure you take away the preſent Moſs.</p>
                     <p>All Canker, filth, and Worms, muſt be picked clean off, and bind ſome Clay well mixt with Hay about the Canker'd place.</p>
                     <p>If the Tree grow but poorly, which is for the moſt part cauſed by the ill temper
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:154132:107"/>of the Soil, open the Ground about the Roots and put in ſome Manure proper to cure it.</p>
                     <p>The Canker aſſaults generally the beſt ſorts of Fruit-trees, as the Pippin, Pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, Harvy-Apple, Golden Rennet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of Pears the Wardens of all ſorts, Burga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mots. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And it ſomtimes comes by gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and fretting of Boughs on each other, and ſomtimes by ſetting Trees not ſhallow but too deep, as well as by Barrenneſs of Soil, and ſomtimes it comes by breaking off Boughs (which ſhould be cut off cloſe to the Tree, tho in the Summer) and Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles nipping off the Buds or pieces of the Tree, or unſeaſonable Pruning.</p>
                     <p>Raiſing of Stocks from Crab kernels in the ſame Land and Grafting on, after once removed, and placed where they are to grow and be Grafted, prevents the Canker.</p>
                     <p>To cure the Canker at preſent, cut it out, if it be upon the body or great Boughs of Trees, and waſh the place with Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dung and urine mixt, and then cover the place with Clay mixed with Horſe-dung, and cut off the ſmall Branches that are dead; however ſtop the cauſe by amending the Soil at Roots with proper Manure, as the Dung of Hogs, Pidgeons, Poultry, Horſes, Cows, the ſediments of Pools, Ponds, Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, Shovelings of yards where Cattle fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to the nature of the Soil.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Some Trees proſper where o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will not.</note>§. 3. You'l often find in the ſame Land ſome kinds of Fruit-trees very ſubject to ſome of the beforementioned evils, and others proſper well; when once you diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver this (becauſe it's utterly in vain to make Ground and Trees of different Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius agree together) you muſt make it your buſineſs by degrees to change your Trees, till you have left none againſt which your Soil beareth ſuch an implacable hatred, and furniſh it with ſuch as will flouriſh and be fruitful.</p>
                     <p>§. 4. If any of your Trees are galled by rubbing on each other,<note place="margin">Bark Gall'd</note> or by being bound to Stakes, or by Thorns, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, lay ſome Clay upon the gald places and wrap Hay-bands about them, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all remove the cauſe by Pruning, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>

                        <pb n="198" facs="tcp:154132:108"/>§. 5.

Hares and Rabbets are very miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous to Nurſeries,<note place="margin">Hares and Coneys.</note> and young Orchards by peeling off the Bark of the Plants; if your Fence be a Wall, or cloſe Pale, or Water, there's little danger of them, but becauſe ſuch Fences about Orchards are rare, and no other can keep them out, ſome expedient muſt be made uſe of.</p>
                     <p>Some have uſed Hay Ropes bound about the Tree from the Ground a ſufficient height; but this were endleſs in a Nurſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it may be done in an Orchard, but there are other ways to be preferr'd before it.</p>
                     <p>Others therefore dawb the bodies of the Trees over with Tar, which being uſed alone endangers the life of very young Plants, and extreamly hardens the Bark, and otherwiſe hurts them, which evil is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by mixing the Tar with any kind of Greaſe, and boiling them on a Fire, ſo as both may incorporate, then with a Bruſh,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:154132:108"/>or little Broom, dawb over the body of the Tree, as high as an Hare or Rabbet can reach, and this is to be done about the tenth of <hi>November,</hi> it will preſerve the Trees for that whole year, with that once doing, it being the Winter time only that they will feed upon the Bark.</p>
                     <p>Some uſe Greaſe alone, and then it will require to be laid on twice in a Winter.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXIX.</hi> Of Gathering Fruit, and the beſt way of making Cyder.</head>
                     <p>§. 1. IN gathering of Fruit, be careful that the Branches of your Trees be not battered and broken.</p>
                     <p>§. 2. Such as you deſign to keep any time, ought not to be ſhaked off the Trees, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of bruiſing, but picked off with your hands: Be ſure the Fruit you gather be throughly ripe, which you may know by it's beginning to drop, or by cutting an Apple, and ſeeing the Kernels turn black: Let the Weather be fair and dry when you gather, and no dew upon the Trees; lay up what you thus gather in a cloſe, but a ſweet room, upon a boarded (but not with Deal) Floor, and not on a Clay, or plaiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Floor, and lay them up without any green Leaves, or Sticks among them. As you find any in your heaps rot, pick them out, and in Froſts cover them with Straw, or Straw Mats, and alſo hang in ſharp Froſts Blankets before the Windows to keep out
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:154132:111"/>the Froſts. Lay every kind by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                     <p>If you have ſome Pears that are choice and laſting, wrap them up in paper, and lay them one by one upon ſhelves, or hang them up by the Stalks, and keep out the Air from them as much as you can.</p>
                     <p>§. 3. In gathering Cyder Fruit, you muſt be ſure to let them be well ripe on the Tree,<note place="margin">Gathering of Cyder Fruit and preparing it for the Mill.</note> for there is much Cyder ſpoild be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Apples are Ground before they are ripe, and all Fruits yield a different Liquor according to the different degrees of maturity of the ſame Fruit; for when it's moſt ripe it yields a richer, pleaſanter and more laſting drink; but if preſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ripe, tho it yields a greater quantity, yet it's but a thin, raw, crude, ſowr, phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick, and unwholeſome drink: Therefore if your Fruit be not ripe all at one time, ſelect ſuch ſorts as are of a like degree of maturity, or if the Wind beat down ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and you are unwilling to ſpoil or loſe them, let them lye dry as long as you can before you grind them, to obtain as great a degree of ripeneſs as they can, and let that Cyder be thoroughly fermented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore barrel'd, and the firſt that is ſpent; neither mix ripe with unripe Fruit, not ought you to permit ſome ſorts of Fruit be too ripe; becauſe it then grows pulpy in Grinding, and will not yield it's Liquor
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:154132:112"/>unleſs ſome Water be mixed therewith; your choice Summer Fruits are ſome of them, as alſo the Pippins, and Renat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ſubject to pulpineſs, if full ripe.</p>
                     <p>Lay ſuch Fruit by themſelves (to be Ground and preſſed for Cyderkin) that are broken; but a ſmall bruiſe does not much injury.</p>
                     <p>Your Apples being well ripe, let them be gently ſhaken down, and laid out of the Sun and Rain, not abroad but in a heap; upon a ſweet and dry Floor that is board<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (but not with Deals, nor on a plaiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erd Floor) and on dry, Rye, Wheat or Oaten Straw, till they have ſweat out and digeſted their crude and phlegmatick hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and there let them ſo lye a fortnight; the Redſtreak and harder Apples you may let lye longer, that is, three weaks or a Month; the longer they lye, the leſs Cyder indeed they will yield, but much the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it being neceſſary to have them as ripe as may be, ſo that too many of them begin not to rot, which rotten ones are to be picked out.</p>
                     <p>Grind not your Apples immediately from the Tree, ſo ſoon as they are throughly ripe, tho they will then yield the greater quantity of Liquor, but neither pleaſant nor laſting, therefore let them lye on heaps as aforeſaid.</p>
                     <p>By hoarding only of Windfalls for ſome time, or untill the time it was expected they
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:154132:112"/>ſhould have been ripe in, doth very much meliorate the Cyder made of them, which otherwiſe might have been very bad.</p>
                     <p>For from the due time, place, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of hoarding of the Fruit is oftentimes the Cyder very good, which otherwiſe might have been very bad.</p>
                     <p>Thus when your Fruit is duly ripe, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, preſerved or hoarded ſome time, it's ready for the Mill.</p>
                     <p>When you bring your Apples to the Mill, or juſt befor you fill them up; pick out, or caſt by, all that are Green, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripe, rotten, or otherwiſe naught, and all Stalks Leaves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that may injure your Cyder, for it's better to want a ſmall quantity of Liquor than to ſpoil the whole.</p>
                     <p>Some are of opinion that rottenneſs in the Apple injureth not the Cyder, but that a convenient quantity of rotten. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples mixt with the ſound is a great help to the Fermentation and Clarification of the Cyder; but it's ſuppoſed they mean ſuch Apples only as have been bruiſed in gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhaking down, or carrying, which will by lying become rotten, and (the skin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whole) be not much the worſe, only the Cyder will retain a ſmack of them; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding which, by no means admit them amongſt your Cyder, that you intend for keeping, but rather make Cyder of them for a more early ſpending: for others
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:154132:113"/>affirm, that one rotten Apple corrupts a whole Veſſel, which I preſume is intended only of putrid rottenneſs.</p>
                     <p>§. 4. Grind not your Apples too ſmall, for if they are not very ſmall Ground,<note place="margin">Of grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Preſſing the Apples.</note> you'l have but little leſs Cyder (altho the contrary is commonly believed.)</p>
                     <p>After your Fruit is Ground, let it ſtand 24 or 48 hours, according as your time and conveniency will admit, ſo that it be altogether in good quantities in large Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels; by ſtanding thus it not only matures, but acquires colour, commendable in Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and alſo cauſes the leſſer part of the Apple eaſily to part with it's juice in the Preſs; therefore obſerve not the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral adviſe to preſs immediatly from the Mill.</p>
                     <p>You may leave a paſſage open in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of your Fat, wherein you keep your bruiſed Apples, during the time of their being therein, from the grinding to the preſſing; and ſome of the Cyder may ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneouſly deſtill into a receiver placed under it, or you may have a falſe Bottom full of holes, that the greater quanty may be had which may run through ſome Tap or other paſſage into your receiver: Cyder thus ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained far excels that which is forced out by the Preſs; as Live Honey that deſtills of it ſelf from the Combs, is much better than that which remains and is preſſed out
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:154132:113"/>afterwards; but this is only uſed to get ſome ſmall quantity of the richeſt Cyder.</p>
                     <p>In preſſing the Apples, in caſe you intend not to uſe (which is bad husbandry) your Pulp, Muſt, or Murc afterwards for the making of Water Cyder, uſually call'd Purre, or Cyderkin, then it is beſt to preſs it as dry as you can, but incaſe you intend to add Water to your Murc, and to preſs it again, then you need not to preſs it very hard, for your Cyder will then be ſomthing the worſe, and ſo will your Purre, or Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derkin: for the laſt ſqueezing is the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and makes your Cyder the rougher; and if any thing will, that gives it a Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy taſt, unleſs it be prevented in the eaſy Grinding; but this only is obſerved when you intend to have ſome rich Cyder, and Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derkin for your own uſe, otherwiſe Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deriſts generally preſs their Apples as hard as they can, altho they intend to make Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derkin of the Murc.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Barrelling of Cyder.</note>§. 5. As your Veſſel under the Cyder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs fills, then take the Liquor, and pour it through ſome Streyner or hair Sieve (which will detain the Pulp and groſſer pieces of Apples from intermixing in the Vat) into a large Vat, from whence moſt preſcribe to tun it immediately into the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels wherein it's to be kept, leſt it's ſpirits ſhould evaporate; but others rather chooſe to caſt a cloth only over the Vat or Tun
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:154132:114"/>to preſerve it, and rather waſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the wild Spirit of the Cyder, in the Tun or Vat, and let it there in ſome ſmall degree purify by ſtanding coverd five or ſix hours in the Vat, before you put it into the Barrel it's to be kept in; then they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate the pure from the impure by leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as many Feces or Dregs to remain on the bottom of the Vat as poſſible; becauſe Dregs very much incommode your Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by making it quickly become acid.</p>
                     <p>Then Tun up the pureſt (leaving the ſediment at bottom of the Vat) Liquor in a Hogſhead or Barrel, ſeaſoned and ſweet, fill it not up by two Gallons at leaſt, and ſtop it up only with a looſe ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for four or five days, and then ſtop it up cloſe with Clay on the top or Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hole, and put a Cork or ſome ſtopper in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>e Vent-hole, looſly putting in the Peg; but for a weeks time or more, you may once a day draw it forth a little, leſt it break the Veſſel, or force ſome other vent; then ſtop it cloſe up alſo, and ſo let it ſtand till you think it may be ſomthing clear, and then pierce it, to try how it fines; The Summer Fruit after a Month, the Moil after the firſt Froſts, the Red ſtreak not till after <hi>January,</hi> other Winter-Fruit Cyder about the ſame time.</p>
                     <p>If the Cyder be ſo clear that it will not again ferment, and you intend to keep it long in the Barrel; put in clean unground
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:154132:114"/>Wheat, after the proportion of a quart to a Hogſhead, which will preſerve it; and this artificial head is only to be uſed, where an admiſſion of Air may probably be into the Veſſel.</p>
                     <p>Stopping of Cyder with Clay, if you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to keep it long, is not ſo good as a Woodden Plug, turn'd fit to the Bunghole, and covered about with a ſingle brown paper wet, before you wring it into it's place, and then let the Plug be well lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on the top and ſides with Clay temperr'd with Salt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">How to fine or clear Cyder.</note>§. 6. If your Cyder be not fine at the times aforementioned, try them again a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a Month after, and then if it be not fine, rack it off as you would do Wine, ſetting another Veſſel in a convenient place, that through a pipe of Leather, or a Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon, or a Crane of ſome metal, (as of Latten) or Glaſs, the Liquor may run out of the one into the other, without being expoſed to the Air, which is a moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial thing to take care of at all times, the ſpirits of Cyder being very apt to eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate.</p>
                     <p>Some chuſe rather to fine their Cyder with Water Glew, commonly call'd Iſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs, than by racking it. And the common and beſt way is that amongſt Vintners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that have frequent uſe for it; and it is to diſſolve a conſiderable quantity of Iſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:154132:115"/>in White Wine, without putting it on the fire, which it will do in about a Months time, and turn to a Jelly, which they keep by them, and it will keep good a Twelvemonth; and when they have occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to uſe it, remove the Scum that will be on the top of it, and take what quantity will ſerve their turn out of it, according to the proportion of a quart to a Hog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhead; and this they beat to a froth, and mix it with a quantity of the Liquor it's to be put in, and them pour it into the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel mixing it well together with a Broom, and ſo leaving the work.</p>
                     <p>Or if your Cyder hath ſtood long, and will not be fine, as oſtentimes it ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth; Then take Iſinglaſs about an Ounce to an Hogſhead, and ſteep it a day or two in about two quarts of Cyder untill the whole be reduced to a Gelly, which by ſtanding warm it will eaſily do, then draw off about a Gallon of the Cyder, and mix the Gelly (being cold) throughly with it, and put the whole into the Veſſel of Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the Bung, and with a ſplitted ſtaff, ſtir it well together, and in a day or two it will be fine without any prejudice to your Cyder.</p>
                     <p>This way of purification will ſerve in all ſorts of Liquors, and is much to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred in the juices of Fruits, to that vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar way of making them to Ferment by the addition of Yeaſt, or Toſts therein dipt,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:154132:115"/>as is uſually preſcribed; that being but an Acid excitation to Fermentation, all things tending to Acidity being (as much as may be) in our operations to be avoided.</p>
                     <p>This way alſo is better than the tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous way of Percolation, and racking from Veſſel to Veſſel, which waſts not only the Spirits, but ſubſtance of the Liquor it ſelf, and leaves you but a thin and flat drink, hardly ballancing your trouble.</p>
                     <p>When your Cyder is very fine, either draw it out of the Veſſel as you drink it, or which is far better, Bottle it: And take notice after it is fine, the ſooner you draw it off the better.</p>
                     <p>§. 7. Altho your Cyder be well made, yet if it be put into ill ſhaped, corrupt,<note place="margin">Of Veſſels for Cyder.</note> faulty, and unſound Veſſels, it's certainly ſpoil'd. Altho the vulgar round Barrel be moſt uſeful, and neceſſary for Tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation from one place to another, yet is the upright Veſſel, whoſe Ribs are ſtreight, and the head about a fourth or fifth part broader than the bottom, and the height equal to the Diameter of the upper part, the beſt form to ſtand in a Cellar. The Bung-hole of about two Inches Diameter, is to be on the top with a Plug of Wood turn'd round exactly to fit into it, near unto which there muſt be a ſmall Vent-hole, that after the Cyder is tumn'd up, and ſtopt at the Bung or Tun-hole, you may give it
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:154132:116"/>Vent at pleaſure; and that when you draw it forth, you may there admit Air into the Veſſel. This is call'd in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> a Stand Barrel, becauſe it's made after the form of a Veſſel which the meaner ſort of People keep their drink in, call'd a Stand. This form is preferred; becauſe that moſt Liquors contract a skin, or cream on the top, which helps much their preſervation, and is in other forms broken by the ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Liquor, but in this is kept whole; which occaſions the freſhneſs of the drink to the laſt. The form hereof is thus.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Choice of Bottles as Corks for Cyder.</note>§. 8. Thick, double Glaſs Bottles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining about quarts apiece, are preferr'd very much to Stone Bottles; becauſe that Stone Bottles are apt to Leak, and more apt to taint than the other, and are ſo rough in the mouth that they are not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uncork'd, neither are they tranſparent, that you may diſcern when they are foul or clean; it being otherwiſe with Glaſs Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, whoſe defects are eaſily diſcern'd, and are of a more compact metal, or ſubſtance, not waſting ſo many Corks. If Glaſs Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels happen to be muſty, they are eaſily cured, by boyling them in a Veſſel of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, putting them in whilſt the Water is cold, which prevents the danger of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if you be ſo cautious as not to ſet them down ſuddenly on a cold Floor, but upon Straw, Board, or ſuch like.</p>
                     <p>If your Glaſs Bottles be foul, you may cleanſe them with hard Sand, or ſome Lead-Shot (each about the bigneſs of an ordinary Peaſe) roll'd, and tumbled up and down with Water, which will alſo in ſome degree take away the muſtineſs from them. Great
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:154132:118"/>care is to be had in chooſing good Corks, much good Liquor being abſolutely ſpoiled through the only defect of the Cork; If the Corks are ſteeped in ſcalding Water a while before you uſe them, they will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply better with the mouth of the Bottle, than if forced in dry: alſo the moiſture of the Cork doth advantage it in detaining the Spirits.</p>
                     <p>§.9. Drawing of Cyder into Bottles, and keeping it in them well ſtopt for ſome time,<note place="margin">Bottling of Cyder.</note> is a great improver of Cyder. This is done after it is throughly purified, and at any time of the year; if it be bottled early, there needs no addition, it having body and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit enough to retrive in the Bottle what it loſt in the Barrel: But if it have been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-fermented, and thereby become poor, flat and eager, then in the Bottling if you add a ſmall quantity of Loaf Sugar, more or leſs according as it may require, it will give a new life to the Cyder, and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly make it better than ever it was before, eſpecially if it were but a little acid, and not Eager.</p>
                     <p>When your Cyder is thus Bottled, if it were new at the Bottling, and not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely pure, it is good to let the Bottles ſtand a while uncork't before you ſtop them cloſe, or elſe open the Corks two or three days after, to give the Cyder Air, which will prevent the breaking the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:154132:118"/>againſt the next turning of the Wind to the South.</p>
                     <p>The meaner Cyder is more apt to break the Bottles than the richer; being of a more Eager nature, and the ſpirits more apt to fly, having not ſo ſolid a body to detain them as the rich Cyders.</p>
                     <p>Obſerve that when the Bottle breaks through the Fermentation of the Cyder, to open your Corks, and give vent, and ſtop them up again a while after, leſt you loſe many for want of this caution. Lay your Bottles ſideways, not only for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Corks moiſt, but for that the Air that remains in the Bottle is on the ſide of the Bottle, where it can neither expire, not can New be admitted, the Liquor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the Cork, which not ſo eaſily paſſeth through the Cork, as the Air. Some place their Bottles on a Frame, with their mouth downwards for that end, which is not to be ſo well approved of, by reaſon that if there be any the leaſt ſettling in the Bottle, you are ſure to have it the firſt Glaſs.</p>
                     <p>Placing Bottles on a Frame, as is uſual, or on Shelves, is not ſo good as on the Ground; by reaſon the farther from the Ground they ſtand, the more are they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Variation of the Air, which is always more rare in the upper, than lower part of a Cellar, or other Room. Setting Bottles in Sand is much uſed, but without
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:154132:119"/>reaſon, becauſe it adds not that coldneſs to the Bottles as is generally expected, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rather of a dry and temperate quality than cold.</p>
                     <p>The placing of Bottles in Wells, or in Ciſterns of Spring Water running, or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often changed, is queſtionleſs the beſt way to preſerve either Ale, Cyder or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Vinous Liquor.</p>
                     <p>A Conſervatory made where a continual recruit of a cool refrigatory Spring Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may conveniently be had, will ſo long preſerve Cyder untill it become to the ſtrength even of Canary it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Where you have not conveniency of Water, or are unwilling to be at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of making ſuch Conſervatories, there the beſt way is to dig Vaults in your Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, under the level of the bottom, or to make Niches in the Walls near the Ground, and in them place your Bottles leaning: for the more they are from the Air, and the more they are encompaſſed with Stone or Earth, the cooler they will continue, and the leſs ſubject to the inconveniences that happen from the mutability of the Ambient Air.</p>
                     <p>Binding down the Corks of your Bottels in caſe of danger is not ſo much to be commended, as well fitting them in by full Corks; becauſe the Liquor were better fly the Cork, that break the Bottles, which
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:154132:119"/>muſt be in caſe the Cork be tyed down, and the Liquor not well qualified.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Reſtoring of Decayed Cyder.</note>§. 10. Sometimes Cyder that hath been good, by ill managment, or other accident be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes dead, flat, ſower, thick, muddy, or muſty, all which in one ſort or other may be helped.</p>
                     <p>Deadneſs or flatneſs in Cyder is often occaſioned, from the too free admiſſion of Air into the Veſſel, for want of right ſtopping; which is cured by preſſing ſome Apples, and put up only the new Muſt or Cyder that comes from them on the decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Cyder, and ſtopping it cloſe, only ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times trying it by opening the ſmall vent, that it force not the Veſſel. The ſame may be done in Bottles, by adding a ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or two of new Muſt or Cyder to each Bottle of dead Cyder, and ſtopping it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. Cyder that is dead or flat, will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes revive again of it ſelf, if cloſe ſtopt, upon the Revolution of the year and approaching Summer.</p>
                     <p>But Cyder that hath acquired a deadneſs or flatneſs, by being kept in a Beer or Ale Veſſel, is not to be revived, the ſmack of the Beer or Ale being the only cauſe of it, will always predominate,</p>
                     <p>Honey or Sugar mixt with ſome Spices and added to the Cyder that is flat, revives it much; let the proportion be according as the diſtemper is that requires it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="222" facs="tcp:154132:120"/>If Cyder be Acid, as ſomtimes it happens, by reaſon of the Immaturity of the Fruit too nimble an operation, too great a Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation in the Veſſel, or too warm a ſituation of your Veſſels wherein it is kept, this ſomtimes becomes pleaſant again, in caſe it's Lee be yet in the Veſſel, as is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by a ſecond operation on it; but in caſe it doth not, if you add about a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon of unground Wheat to a Hogſhead of it, it will very much ſweeten it, and make it pleaſant; The ſame effect will two or three Eggs put in whole, or a pound of Figgs ſlit, produce, as is reported; but the ſureſt remedy is Bottling it with a knob of Sugar proportion'd according to the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>
                     <p>Wheat Boyled till it begin to break, and when cold, added to the Cyder, but not in too great a quantity, and ſtirred into it, helpeth it much.</p>
                     <p>If your Cyder be Muſty, which happens either from the place the Fruit lay in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Grinding, or from the Veſſels through which the Pulp or Muſt hath paſt, or that the Cyder is contained in, the cure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is very difficult, altho in ſome meaſure the ill ſavour of it may be corrected, by Muſtard-Seed ground with ſome of the ſame Cyder.</p>

                     <p>Note that there are ſeveral Cyder Mills lately found out which are better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by ſeeing one, than any deſcription can be given, and they are excellent to grind Apples before you preſs them.</p>

                     <p>By the additon of Water no other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage can be expected than the encreaſe of the Liquor, as more ſmall Beer than ſtrong is uſually made of the ſame quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Malt.

<pb facs="tcp:154132:139"/>two Inches thick with good Earth, except the top Branch or Twigg, which muſt lye, out and be uncover'd, and by that time the next year, you'l have abundance of well Rooted Plants, fit to tranſplant: take care to keep that part of the uncover'd Stock, which is between the old Root and the Cover'd part, that it run not out in Buds or Branches, for if it do, the Twigs will be rob'd of that nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which ſhould feed them: Alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to keep them clear of all Graſs and Weeds that may in the leaſt annoy them.</p>

                  <p>Stocks from Plum-ſtones, and Budded with a Peach will make a more firm and laſting Peach-tree; and ſuch as will bear Fruit well.</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>THere are Perſons who perſwade themſelves that its a crime to add any thing to Antiquity, and who ſay, That nothing can be invented of new more than what the Ancients have ſaid; and that it is a vain Glory and Preſumption to imagine we can ſay any thing which has not been written. But if it were free for me to Anſwer this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, I would ſay, That Arts are not of thoſe things to which nothing can be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and that the Older the World grows, the more they are carryed on to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Anatomy</hi> did not appear in ſo
<pb facs="tcp:154132:143"/>great a Luſter in the Time of <hi>Galen,</hi> as in our Days: and the <hi>Art of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Fruit-trees</hi> was not ſo perfect in the Time of the <hi>Curate of Henonvil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le,</hi> as at preſent. We are like a Dwarf on a Giants ſhoulders. We ſee much farther than our Fathers, and we dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcover things which they knew not. I will not ſay for this, that there are not any precepts or Rules found for Pruning Trees in the <hi>Books of Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture and Gardening</hi> which have been Printed within Twenty or Five and Twenty Years, I candidly own that there are ſome; but in truth they are ſo few in Number, and the greateſt part ſo obſcure, and ſo little to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly'd on, that I very much doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they may be followed without committing faults. If on the contrary you ſtick to thoſe which I give in this Tract; many Years experience has aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd me, that Trees Prun'd according
<pb facs="tcp:154132:143"/>to the Rules which I Eſtabliſh, will produce great Fruits in abundance. I have therefore reduc't <hi>The Art of Pruning Fruit-Trees</hi> into four Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and I have caus'd ſeven Figures to be Grav'd which I Judg'd neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the underſtanding of what I ſay: The firſt Chapter Treats of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Trees in the Month of <hi>February.</hi> The ſecond explains that of the beginning of <hi>May.</hi> The third teaches the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at the end of <hi>May</hi> and the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>June.</hi> Laſtly the Fourth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes the Pruning of <hi>July.</hi> I thought fit to reduce this Book into a form of precepts, without forming a continued Diſcourſe; becauſe often we have need of one precept, without having need of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: and I have writ it after ſo popular a manner that the moſt Illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Gardiners might comprehend what I would ſay.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> The Pruning or Lopping of Fruit-trees, for the Month of <hi>February.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>ALmoſt all Trees begin to ſprout forth in <hi>France</hi> toward the end of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>March;</hi> and this is the motion which we call the riſe of the Sap, or the ſhooting of Trees. This ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs happens variouſly, the diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Air, the goodneſs of the Soil, the vigour or the kind of the Tree, make the Saps or ſhootings to come earlier or later: They come early in a dry year, and are backward in a moiſt.</p>
                        <p>This riſe of the Sap invites then Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to Prune or Lop Trees in the Month of <hi>February,</hi> which is the moſt proper time for this work; and tho' it may be done all the Winter, however the Moon be diſpos'd, Trees being then at reſt as to their Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; nevertheleſs it is much better to ſtay for this till the Colds are paſt, and that the Rains no longer infeſt the wounds which
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:154132:145"/>are made on Trees; by this means they ſeal themſelves in a little time, and ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner cover the wound which has been made on them.</p>
                        <p>Before you Prune or Lop a Tree, you ought to conſider the ſtrength and kind of it for rendring it beautiful and fertile; for all Trees are not to be Lopt after the ſame faſhion: We Lop diverly (for inſtance) a Peach-Tree and a Winter Pear-Tree; and its by Lopping of this laſt, that the skill of the Gardiner ſhews it ſelf the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuouſly, and that we judge beſt of his ability.</p>
                        <p>There are Trees which we dare not Lop, by reaſon of the abundance of their Sap; for the more we Lop them, the more Wood they ſhoot forth, and the leſs Fruit; even the Flower-buds yield Wood, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens often to the Tree, which yields the delicate Pear call'd <hi>the little Rouſſelet;</hi> to the lateward <hi>Bergamot,</hi> to the <hi>Virgoleuſe,</hi> to the St. <hi>Lezan, &amp;c.</hi> But when theſe ſorts of Trees have ſhot forth their full, after this they bear but too much. In this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion Lop ſometimes ſhort, and ſometimes long, or not at all: take away ſometimes the young Wood, and preſerve the old; another while cut away the old, for the Tree to grow young again; at another time cut away the Branches, and all the falſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:154132:146"/>Sprouts, but remember never to diſgarniſh the Stock, by Lopping away all the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Branches of the ſides of the Tree, and making the Trunk bare.</p>
                        <p>Gardiners have a very true Maxim, <hi>Lop in fair Weather, in the decreaſe of the Moon, and in the end of the Saps, or rather when Trees are at rest.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The decreaſe of the Moon of <hi>January,</hi> which happens in <hi>February,</hi> is the true time for Lopping Trees, and for preſerving Grafts; not but this Rule has ſome excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for weak Trees, and thoſe that are Planted but of that year, ought to be Lopt at the new Moon, to make them ſprout vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly: And we muſt remember that Trees ought not to be cut when we Plant them, but we ought to ſtay till the Month of <hi>February</hi> following.</p>
                        <p>When you Plant a Graft of three years, which has Flower-buds, preſerve ſome to ſee the Fruit in the firſt year: It is of theſe ſorts of Trees that you muſt always make choice, they ſhew from their beginning an aſſured fruitfulneſs, and bear afterward a great deal of Fruit as long as they live.</p>
                        <p>Becauſe it is known that an abundance of Sap makes but Branches, and that a little or mean Sap makes Fruit: and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over that the Moon has leſs influence on ſublunary things, when ſhe begins to be in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:154132:146"/>the Wain, than when ſhe Increaſes; expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience has taught us that the decreaſe of the Moon is the moſt kindly time for Lopping Trees, which have then leſs of motion. The decreaſe is from the time of the Full to the New, nevertheleſs ſome will have it that we may Lop Trees during the time that the Moon is not horned, that is to ſay, from her eighth day to her one and Twentieth. They ſay that it is not only the Moon which cauſes Fruit on Trees, but the diſpoſition of the Branches; and that it ſuffices that the Moon has ſtrength, provided that on the other ſide ſhe finds in a Branch, Fibres tranſverſe and diſpos'd to cauſe Fruit-buds to be there form'd. True it is, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence has taught me that the Seeds of Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers caſt into the Earth during all this time, turn double ſooner than thoſe that are Sown in another time.</p>
                        <p>We ought firſt to Lop Apricock, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctarin, and Peach-trees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe they ſhoot forth the firſt; the Winter Pear-trees follow next, after theſe thoſe of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn and of Summer, and the Portugal Quince-trees: We ought ſhortly after to Lop and Prune Plum-trees, and Apple-trees, and laſtly Spaniſh Pomegranet-trees, becauſe all theſe Trees ſhoot forth the one after the other; but above all, we ought not to Lop this laſt till it has ſhot forth a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:154132:147"/>little, that we may the better diſtinguiſh the weak or dead Branches.</p>
                        <p>After the Obſervations which we even now made, we ought to begin to Lop and Trim up a Tree by one of its ſides from the lower part to the top, and we ought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward to carry on our Work without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and to take one Branch after the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This ſide being thus Lopt and paled, we deſcend on the other ſide from the top to the bottom in the ſame Order.</p>
                        <p>We muſt here remember always to cut the Branches in the form of a Hinds foot, ſo that the Sun may not dry the wound, which ought to be as far as we may on the North ſide; but after ſuch a manner that the ſloping ſide of the wound be not too ſtraight downward, to the end that the knot be not endammag'd; otherwiſe the eye which ought to puſh forth wood, being cut too much by the ſlope of a too ſtreight deſcent (chiefly in tender Trees) will not puſh forth at all or weakly, and will communicate ev'n to five or ſix eyes the evil of a wound ill made.</p>
                        <p>We muſt further remember to cut always a Branch near a Wood-bud, and never near a Flower-bud; becauſe in this laſt Lop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, the Fruit which would come there, would not be ſecured by the Leaves againſt the injury of the Air. Moreover the Branch
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:154132:147"/>would be expos'd to the Air, and finally the wound would not cloſe it ſelf, nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come to an Eſchar the Pears carrying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all the Sap, that ought to make it:</p>
                        <p>We ought not moreover to leave a Stub to a Branch which we cut at a Wood-bud, that we may give way to the Branch to cloſe it ſelf in a ſhort time by the ſprout that ought to grow there; I ſay not the ſame of a Branch which we cut an Eye or two from the Trunk; this may put forth near the Stub, which we leave there, ſome Fruit. buds, or ſome Branches which will have diſpoſitions to produce them, at leaſt if the Branch be little or of a mean ſize; for if it be great, it ought to be cut near the Tree. If in Lopping where we leave a Stub, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhoots forth there, the year follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Stub muſt be cut ſmooth to the Tree.</p>
                        <p>I ſpeak not here only of Fruit with Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, we ought ev'n to leave a Stub to Fruits with Stones, not to make them puſh forth Wood there, for this is not their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, but to keep them from being cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the Weather, and not to cauſe them to puſh forth Gum there, which is their Sap, and in this occaſion their Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Enemy.</p>
                        <p>When the little Branches are too con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd, care muſt be taken to cut them off
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:154132:148"/>an Eye or two from the main Branch, or near the Trunk as I have ſaid, both to disburthen the Tree, and to make it puſh forth ſome Branches anew, but after ſuch a manner, that there be always room for placing the Sprig which will come.</p>
                        <p>We ought alſo to Obſerve that to fill out a Tree well, its Branches ought not to be diſtant from each other above a Fingers breadth.</p>
                        <p>You muſt never cut Fruit-buds whatever reaſons are alledged thereon; Trees at that time do what they are ordain'd for, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing their Riches, and Nature gives us what we demand of her for recompence of our cares and Labours.</p>
                        <p>We know a Fruit-bud by its Figure, by the ſmall bearer where it comes, by the motion it makes in the ſhoot of the Tree or finally by the abundance of Leaves that accompany it.</p>
                        <p>If a little and long Branch be well ſtor'd with Flower-buds, do not cut any of them (I ſay it once again) and do not ſo much as touch the Branch, wait rather till the Flowers are come forth of the Bud to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them, or till the Fruit are kern'd to cut with Sciſſars the Stems of the leaſt and worſt form'd; by this means you will not cut away the Bud which will produce o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:154132:148"/>Fruit the following years when the Branch has fortified it ſelf.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheleſs, if for ſome great reaſon, we are Obliged to cut Flower-buds in a Branch bared of ſhoots, for drawing thither the Sap, and to cauſe ſome void ſpace to be fill'd, and that there are no other Branches found for ſupplying this Default, we muſt cut the Branch at a Wood-knot to fill out the Tree, and we muſt take good heed not to cut it near the Flower or Fruit-buds, for the reaſons which we have mentioned, and after this we muſt take away the Fruit-buds to give it more ſtrength to puſh forth.</p>
                        <p>The old Buds which have yielded Fruit for many years together, and which give us no longer hope of producing more, muſt be cut away to embelliſh the Tree, and to disburthen it of ſomewhat which is uſeleſs and ſuperfluous.</p>
                        <p>The bearers which are two, three, or four Inches long are the beſt, eſpecially when they Iſſue from the great Branches near the top of the Tree; they bring forth many years one after the other, and bear very great Fruit. Thoſe which are bared of Branches laſt indeed a long time; but they do not bear ſo Beautiful Fruit, and often they are drain'd, unleſs you cut the Stems of the Pears with Sciſſars; and thoſe which are
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:154132:149"/>not above a nail in length, and which come from the Trunk, bring forth very great Fruit; but ordinarily they laſt but a year</p>
                        <p>A Shoot of <hi>Auguſt</hi> never yields Fruit, the Wood is not then well fill'd with Sap, it ought always to be cut away, unleſs it be extreamly neceſſary for filling a void ſpace.</p>
                        <p>If a uſeleſs or irregular Branch grows be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, it is always cut away, ev'n tho' it has on it a Flower-bud; for the Fruit which would come of it, would be ſpoil'd by the ſhadow of the Tree, and would be good for nothing: if it be before, we cut it an Eye or two from the Mother Branch, to try to make ſome Flower-buds ſpring forth there.</p>
                        <p>A Branch bent by force bears much Fruit, but it is ſmall, unleſs it were plyed ſo the firſt year; the reaſon is evident, its Fibres are bent, and the Sap does not carry it ſelf briskly to it.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes forked ſprouts, or knots of Scions ſhoot forth from certain places of Trees, when they are Old and at a ſtand that they need to be cut to renew them. In this occaſion we ought to cut at a good length a Maſter Sprig in Pear-trees and Apple-trees, and to cut ſome an Eye or two from the Mother Branch, and cut others near the Trunk, but in Necta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:154132:149"/>and Peach-trees, we ought to cut all the leſſer Branches an Eye or two from the Mother Branch, and let the longeſt and ſtreighteſt run on, tho' it would be the ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt way in theſe laſt Trees, to cut a great Branch near the Trunk, or to cut the Trees two or three Fingers breadth from the Earth to renew them.</p>
                        <p>You muſt cut one Branch ſhort betwixt two long to fill out the Tree. The year following the ſhort Branch muſt be cut long, and the long ſhort: It is the ſecret to have much Fruit, and to preſerve Trees; there are ſome who ſay that a Tree Lopt after that manner is not agreeable to behold: but I deſire them to ſtay to conſider them till the Month of <hi>May;</hi> and I am well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd they will change their ſentiment.</p>
                        <p>A Tree is ordinarily compos'd of three ſorts of Branches, we find on it <hi>Ravenous</hi> or <hi>Prodigal, Indifferent,</hi> and <hi>Fertile.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. The <hi>Ravenous</hi> grow moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the top of the Tree, and ſometimes they ſpring from an Old Branch; they are finely even and without Moſs, greater and more ſmooth than the others.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The <hi>Indifferent</hi> are of a mean ſort, among which there are ſometimes ſome well ſupply'd with Juice, they bearing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Fruit within three or four years.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The <hi>Fertile</hi> are ordinarily ſmall, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:154132:150"/>growing athwart; ſometimes there are found of them great and long; they always bear Fruit; there are counted five ſorts of them.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The firſt have in their ſource, and in the place whence they ſpring, little Wrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les like Rings; which ſhew that in this place there are tranſverſe Fibres in the Wood. Its in theſe Fibres where is made a ſlow circulation of the Sap of the Tree, which produces the Flower-bud, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as when the Fibres are all ſtreight, the Sap is carryed upward vigorouſly and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſiſtance, and not ſtaying it ſelf in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny place, it produces nought but Wood: We may Obſerve theſe tranſverſe Fibres in cutting the Wood where there are of theſe Rings, the cut will not be cloſe and even as elſewhere.</p>
                        <p>The Figure following will Repreſent to you the Fertile Branch.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. Of theſe three ſorts of Branches, that is to ſay, of the Prodigal, Indifferent, and Fertile, the Prodigal are always cut very ſhort at the firſt or ſecond knot, to make the Sap paſs to another ſide of the Tree, and produce there Branches Indifferent or Fertile. This Lopping reiterated many times, makes the Prodigal Dye, or at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe hinders the Tree from puſhing them ſo vigorouſly. Its by reaſon of this experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that we ought not to cut Trees much, becauſe by cutting them in all their Branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, they are made to Languiſh and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to Dye. The Prodigals which have been cut many times the precedent year, ought to be Lopt at the firſt knot near the Mother Branch whence it grows, as the Fourth Figure ſhews.</p>

                        <p>Lop therefore the top of the Tree, where the Prodigal Branches are Ordinarily found, and ſpread it at the bottom and at the ſides; this Lopping gracefully fills a Tree, and hinders it from Growing to too great a height and from deſtroying it ſelf in a ſhort time.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. As for the Indifferent Branches, ſome
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:154132:153"/>of them ought to be Lopt, others not; that is to ſay, we ought in the Month of <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi> to let thoſe grow on which have Buds for Wood very near each other, and which iſſue from a good place, as alſo thoſe which have two great Leaf-buds which touch each other at the end of the Branch; to the end we may know their Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us at the Lopping of <hi>June.</hi> The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and beſt ſupply'd with Juice will be the beſt for keeping. The Indifferent which we ought to cut at the third or fourth knot, are thoſe which are leaſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to bear Fruit, and which have the Leaf-buds far from one another.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The Fertile ought never to be Lopt, tho' they are as long as the Arm; Trees left to run up from which we Lop no Branches and which bear ſo much Fruit, ſhew us well that we ought never to Lop the Fertile: nevertheleſs, if there be need of them for filling up a void ſpace where it happens, and that no other Branch can be found for this purpoſe, I permit them to be cut for embelliſhing the Tree.</p>
                        <p>And to explain my ſelf farther in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concerning a Fertile Branch, I ſay that that which has Rings in its ſource, Wrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les at the beginning of its ſhoot of <hi>May</hi> or of <hi>June,</hi> or finally knots near each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ought not to be cut without a great
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:154132:153"/>neceſſity; for experience has taught me that all theſe Branches bear Infallibly their Fruit toward the end of their Branches, which our ill Gardiners always cut away, So at the beginning of <hi>February</hi> Obſerve exactly the end of the ſhoots of the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent year, that you may always cut the Branch when the Saps are at a ſtand at the firſt or ſecond knot in the Wood which comes after, and to leave all the knots which will be as many Flower-buds, that will not fail to form themſelves there in two or three years. Its an Obſervation which will embelliſh your Trees by the abundance of Fruits which they will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce. That which I ſay being ſomewhat difficult to comprehend without ſeeing it, the fifth Figure will make you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it.</p>

                        <p>The Fertile Branches which Iſſue from a Bud which has yielded Fruit, and which have not been cut at the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> ought not to be cut in <hi>February,</hi> unleſs they are double. In this occaſion we muſt let run the better, and Lop the other at the firſt or ſecond knot. Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence has taught me that theſe Branches ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fail of bearing Fruit the ſecond or third year. See the third Figure.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the ſame Experience has taught me that the Fruit-buds which come at the end of the Branches in Trees whoſe Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us is often to bear their Fruit in this place, ought not to be cut, eſpecially if they produce little, and we ſhould have but few <hi>Gracioli, Coins Francs,</hi> nor <hi>Grenades d'Eſpagne,</hi> if we ſhould cut theſe ſorts of Trees at the end of their Branches.</p>
                        <p>It is ſaid that the Fruits which come at ends of Branches are ſmall, and that the Wind blows them down. I own that the firſt default is without remedy, but the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:154132:155"/>Second is not ſo, for we may bind up the Branch laden with Fruit againſt the Wind. Nature doing well what ſhe does, when ſhe places a Fruit-bud at the end of a Branch of a Pear-tree, has an intent to render this Branch Fertile; for the Fruit which ſhe produces there, ſeals that Branch, and hinders it from puſhing forth afterward; this Branch receiving not then much Sap, forms in all its length an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of Fruit-buds, and two or three years after it is all deckt with them; which it continues to do for five or ſix years following, till the Branch is worn out; if this Flower-bud be cut away the Sap will come freely and vigorouſly into the Branch cut, and inſtead of the Fruit which Nature had there deſign'd, we ſhall have nought but Wood through the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diners Ignorance.</p>
                        <p>When we will have larg Fruit, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the <hi>Bon-Chretien</hi> and in other Trees, which bear great, we ought to Lop ſhort, the nearer the Fruit-buds are to the Trunk, the greater the Fruit is, for it receives more of the Juice.</p>
                        <p>There are Gardiners who make the Buſh of a Tree too thin by cutting away the little Branches, and leaving the Trunk al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt bare: we might leave in it ſome clear ſpace in the middle and the ſides, to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:154132:155"/>give entrance to the Sun which muſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour the Pears, but we ought not to cut it too much: the ſhadow of the Leaves ought to ſecure the Trunk of the Tree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the parching heat of the Sun which makes it chop, and which breeds the Scab and the Canker by the dryneſs of its Bark. Tree it is that we ought to cut ſhorter Trees with a round Buſh head than <hi>Eſpaliers,</hi> and that we ought not to let them run up too much: In a ſtrong and moiſt Soil we muſt keep a Buſh head thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Branches than in another Soil, which is poor and dry; but in all places we ought to keep it well filled, and not cut away the Branches in the midſt of it as much as is done at this day.</p>
                        <p>The niceſt Trees do not delight in this Figure, Pear-trees do not much take to it, and Apricock-trees leſs. Trees Grafted on the great Quince-tree, are more proper for it than thoſe which are Grafted on a Pear-tree, theſe later cannot be reduc't, the more you cut them the more they ſhoot of Wood; and beſides with this, they do not bring forth much Fruit, their nature being to be always high.</p>
                        <p>Cherry-trees which bear ſharp Cherries, grow very well with a Buſh head, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that they are Grafted on the ſmall bitter Cherry-tree; and they take to it
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:154132:156"/>better yet if they are permitted to grow up, for they do not much delight in the Pruning-knife, and leſs when they are old.</p>
                        <p>The Plum-tree is of the ſame nature with the Cherry-tree; it is ordered alſo after the ſame manner.</p>
                        <p>We ought rather to cut a Branch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, than to cut it in many places; the divers wounds which we give Trees, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay them, and make them dye languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, witneſs the <hi>Prodigal,</hi> which we kill by often cutting.</p>
                        <p>Experience has taught me for many years following, that Fruit with ſtones (that is to ſay the Apricock-tree, the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctarin, and the Peach-tree) ought not to be Lop't as Pear-trees.</p>
                        <p>We ought only to cut away Branches, and ſometimes the greateſt to make them renew themſelves: and contrary to the cuſtome of other Trees, they bear in young ſhoots which lade themſelves with Fruit the firſt year. Its after this manner that they laſt Twenty or Thirty years; the more therefore that a Peach-tree ſhoots forth, the more Fruit it bears.</p>
                        <p>We never ought in theſe Sorts of Trees to cut a Branch in the middle, tho' the Apricock-tree is not ſo much damnified by it as the others; becauſe they have a larg
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:154132:156"/>Pith very ſuſceptible of the injuries of the Air. The wound often cauſes five or ſix knots to dye in a Branch, which has been cut after that manner, and by taking off with the Pruning-knife the end of the Branch, as is ordinarily done, we carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way at the ſame time the Fruit that ought to form it ſelf there, and we leave but an end of a Branch which brings nought but Wood.</p>
                        <p>I ſay it once again; the Fruit comes but at the end of the ſhoot of the two firſt Saps; if we Lop away this end, we car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry away the Fruit, and we blockiſhly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive our ſelves of that which we ſeek with ſo much paſſion. Its a remark which we ought well to Obſerve, for the Sap ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſpent and as it were wearied it ſelf after having paſt all along a Branch, does not exert it ſelf with ſo much vigour, and its motion is not ſo impetuous, nor ſo nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the end of a Branch as in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it; alſo it employs it ſelf rather to form Buds for Flowers when it acts mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, than when it agitates it ſelf with ſo much praecipitation.</p>
                        <p>Becauſe Fruit with Stones ſhoot more briskly and more in confuſion than Pear-trees, we muſt alſo take good heed to Lop them with diſcretion. Theſe Trees having ſhot forth vigorouſly a Branch during one
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:154132:157"/>year, and having produced Fruit there, loſe their force in this ſame Branch the year following, and ſhoot forth nought but Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons here and there, but which are laden with an infinite number of Fruit; and the greateſt part of theſe ſame Scions dye the year following as well as all the annual buds of the Tree. When a great Branch is old we ought to cut it in its Source, as you may ſee in the Figure following.</p>

                        <p>The Nectarine and the Peach-tree, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the nature of thoſe Trees which ſhoot much in their tops, we muſt not hope to be able to ſubdue them as Pear-trees, and force them to fill themſelves well in the lower part: if we Lop them as theſe Trees, that is to ſay, if we Lop their Branches in the middle we hinder them indeed from ſhooting in their tops, but they do not fill themſelves for this in their low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part; they mount always, and by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them after that manner, no Fruit comes of it, and we kill them in a ſhort time.</p>
                        <p>In general, the Plum-tree and the Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-tree delight more in Lopping than the Apple-tree: but all three of them do not delight in it as much as the Pear-tree, which is the only Tree that endures it beſt. We muſt take nought from theſe three firſt Trees but the dead Wood, unleſs we will form them at firſt for <hi>Buſh-trees</hi> or <hi>Eſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Becauſe the Corand-tree has much Pith, and that it comes eaſily of a ſlip, its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture does not endure it to be Lopt in the middle of its Branches, no more than the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:154132:158"/>Peach-tree; above all we muſt take good care of cutting it, when we ſet it. We ought in an old Corand-tree to cut near the Root a Branch paſt bearing, in order to renew it, and to cut alſo from the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part ſome young ſhoots of the year to hinder it from being too much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd. The young ſhoots which we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, ſerve to renew it when we cut it in its old Wood. Nevertheleſs, tho' it does not delight in being Lopt, we make Buſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of it, and form it in an Eſpalier, which is beautiful to behold, at the time that it is laden with Fruit.</p>
                        <p>I ſay the ſame of the Mulberry-tree, and of the Fig-tree, which cannot endure the knife by reaſon of the abundance of their Pith; the laſt eſpecially is viſibly damnified by it, unleſs we Lop from them great uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Branches, for rendring them regular: and neither of them can be made to grow low, they love too much the free and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Air.</p>
                        <p>Medlar-trees and Service-trees natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grow high, the former endure the knife much more than the latter.</p>
                        <p>The Portugal Quince-trees, and the Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granate-trees of <hi>Spain</hi> will not be Lopt, becauſe they bear their Fruit at the end of their Branches. Nevertheleſs we may take from them entire Branches, which cauſe a
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:154132:159"/>confuſion, and which are old; and cut near the Trunk the uſeleſs Prodigals, which are uſual enough in theſe ſorts of Trees. As for the other Prodigals which embelliſh the Tree, and which in four or five years will yield Fruit, we ought not to Lop them.</p>
                        <p>Care muſt be taken to cover the great Wounds of Trees with a Plaiſter made of a pound of <hi>Drogue a flambeau,</hi> four Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Roſine, and two Ounces of Sheeps Sewet. When we walk in our Garden in a fine day of the Month of <hi>April,</hi> we muſt have in our hand a Magdaleon of the Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ev'n now mentioned, we muſt cut a little of it with a knife, and after having wrought it betwixt the moiſtn'd Fingers, for rendring it a little ſoft, we muſt apply it on the great Wounds, which we had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got to ſeal in the Month of <hi>March.</hi> And to the end that this Plaiſter may keep the longer on the Wounds, we muſt put on it a bit of paper as a binder, which we muſt preſs on ſoftly with the Finger, to the end that the heat of the Summer making the Plaiſter melt, the paper may preſs it, ſtay it, and glew it more to the Wood: it is what we ought to do in the two other Loppings following.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>IN the Decreaſe of the Moon of <hi>May,</hi> which happens often in <hi>June,</hi> you muſt Lop Trees for the ſecond time; but with more moderation than in <hi>February:</hi> for we ought never in <hi>June</hi> to cut great Branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and properly ſpeaking, it is but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopping of Trees.</p>
                        <p>We muſt wait above all till the Sap be ended, according to the Maxim which we have alleag'd before, and it will be good to repeat it here: <hi>Lop in Fair wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the Decreaſe of the Moon, at the end of the Saps; or rather when Trees are at reſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The reſt of a Tree is known by a bud Garniſh't ordinarily with two Leaves, which forms it ſelf at the end of the Branches, and we obſerve chiefly this bud at the end of <hi>May,</hi> or at the beginning of <hi>June,</hi> that is to ſay, after the firſt Sap or ſhooting.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="34" facs="tcp:154132:161"/>The ſecond Sap or ſhooting of Trees begins ordinarily in the middle of <hi>June,</hi> and ends a Month after, towards <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen</hi>-tide, ſo that betwixt the end of the firſt Sap, and the beginning of the ſecond there is about a Month: and its at this time that we muſt cut Trees again.</p>
                        <p>The effect of this re-cutting is to make the Buds of the firſt Sap to fill up, to force Trees to make Fertile Branches, or to form Flower-buds for the following year; whereas the Lop of <hi>February,</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes but Wood to yield Fruit three years after, if we except the <hi>Orange,</hi> the <hi>Berga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mot,</hi> the <hi>Double-flower,</hi> the <hi>Summer Bon-Chretien,</hi> and ſome others.</p>
                        <p>You ought here to call to mind that we have diſtinguiſht the Branches of Trees Into <hi>Prodigals, Indifferent</hi> and <hi>Fertile.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There are few Trees Grafted on cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Trees, and on Trees come of Kernels, which do not yield ſome <hi>Prodigal</hi> in the firſt Sap, and which do not continue even to yield of them in the others. Care muſt be taken therefore to cut them at the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Leaf-bud, and thus to correct the ſhoot which tranſports it ſelf, and which draw a great part of the Sap of the Tree. O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>As for Trees Grafted on the great Quince trees, they have not often of theſe ſorts o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                           <pb n="35" facs="tcp:154132:161"/>Prodigal ſhoots: and ſome Gardiners are ev'n of the mind that they ought not to be Lopt at this time, and that the tops of them ought only to be pincht off with the Nails.</p>
                        <p>We muſt not deal with the Indifferent Branches as with the Prodigal: for we ought to keep the beſt without touching them, and obſerve exactly thoſe which we permitted to run on in the Month of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary.</hi> If theſe have good marks for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Fertile, we muſt cut nothing there; but if they have not, they muſt be cut ſhort enough to make them yield ſome; that is to ſay, they muſt be cut at the fifth or ſixth knot for Leaves: As for the other <hi>Indifferents,</hi> we ought to cut them at half a foot, or ev'n a foots length, for rendring them Fertile the year follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The <hi>Indifferents</hi> which we muſt not cut, have particular marks which we have obſerv'd in the firſt Chapter.</p>
                        <p>We ought not to touch the Fertile Branches for the reaſons mentioned elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, unleſs it be ſometimes thoſe which Iſſue from a Flower-bud which has fail'd.</p>
                        <p>Before I paſs farther, it will be proper for me to explain my ſelf on what I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſay by a Flower-bud which has fail'd; and you muſt give me leave to make two ſorts of Flower-buds. One ſort is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:154132:162"/>and never ſhoots forth Wood: they are theſe which will yield Fruit in a ſhort time. The others ſhoot forth Wood when the Sap abounds too much, or when we cut a Tree too ſhort, and that by this means we draw the Sap too much toward theſe ſorts of Buds. They are theſe Buds which will not blow under two or three years. Their Origine, their ſituation, and their-Figure make them eaſily diſtinguiſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to a Gardiner which has experience and a good ſence. This being thus eſtabliſht, I may ſay that a Scion which ſhoots in a Fruit-bud which has fail'd, is ſituated in a good place for being called Fertile as I have ſaid it elſewhere; and that if the Sap of the Tree had not been ſo abundant, to make this Bud ſhoot which yielded the Scion, doubtleſs this Bud would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the year following a Flower-bud; beſides the Fibres of the Bud being tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, cauſe the Sap to circulate more ſlowly, and during all this time the Sun concocts and digeſts the humour to form there Fruit-buds for Fruit.</p>
                        <p>I thought good to alledge all this, to ſhew the errour wherein ſome are, who will have us always to cut this Scion, ev'n when the Fruit has fail'd, and for this they call it a falſe and an ill ſhoot. But experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence has taught me that it has marks of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:154132:162"/>Fertileneſs, and that two years, or at far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt three years afterward, if it were not cut away, it would furniſh it ſelf with Flower-buds; and would bear during ſix or ſeven years an infinite number of Fruit.</p>
                        <p>If therefore the Flower-bud which is on a little bearer, that has fail'd, which would yield Fruit the next year or two years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſhoots Wood; it ought to be cut ſhort in <hi>June,</hi> to make it form there Fruit-buds, which happens ſometimes otherwiſe through the abundance of the Sap; for a Scion or two form themſelves there as may be ſeen in the third Figure.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheleſs, there are ſome who will not have us to cut this Scion in <hi>June;</hi> they preſerve it for the Fruit, and cut it long in the Month of <hi>February</hi> following, or do not Lop them at all; and if there are two, they let the beſt grow, and cut the other an Eye or two from the Mother-Branch.</p>
                        <p>But however, I think we muſt here diſtinguiſh two ſorts of Scions which come in a Flower-bud which has fail'd. There are bearers and vigorous Buds, which ſhoot forth two or three Scions, whereof ſome are long and ſlender, others ſhort and ſlender, and others again ſhort and thick: We muſt not touch theſe laſt; becauſe moſt commonly a Flower-bud forms it ſelf there,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:154132:163"/>and we muſt not always cut the others an Eye or two from the Mother-Branch: If ſome diſpoſition for a Flower-bud forms it ſelf near the Scion, cut within an Eye or two of the Mother-Branch, we muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of it from the liberal hand of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; if none be form'd there, and that another Scion grows there, they muſt be left for the Months of <hi>July</hi> or <hi>February</hi> following. If the Bud which produces the Scion, be weak, we muſt not touch it, but we muſt preſerve the Scion for the Fruit, at leaſt if it appears well furniſht with Sap in <hi>Auguſt;</hi> for if we cut it, it will be at a ſtand and will not ſhoot.</p>
                        <p>We muſt cut larger in <hi>June</hi> than in <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary;</hi> becauſe it is at that time that we give the Figure to the Tree for the year following, and that we cauſe Fruit-buds to be form'd for two years after.</p>
                        <p>If Grafts within a cleft made in the top of a Stock; are vigorous the year that they are Grafted, it is better (as ſome think) to pinch the ends of them away with the Nails at the beginning of <hi>June,</hi> than to cut them. But experience has taught me that if we deſign a Graft which ſhoots vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly either for a Buſh head or for an <hi>Eſpalier,</hi> we ought to cut it at the New of the Moon, three or four Months after it is Grafted, to make it ſpread below,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:154132:163"/>and to ſecure it from the Wind: We gain a year by ſo doing.</p>
                        <p>As for Trees which we deſign to let run up to a height it will be good not to cut them at all till the ſecond year.</p>
                        <p>We muſt not touch the firſt year a Bud Grafted, be it never ſo vigorous; we muſt wait the year following to cut the Stump of the Tree come of Seed, mean while care muſt be taken to ſtay it up againſt the Wind.</p>
                        <p>I repeat it once again here, that we ought never to cut Flower-buds, becauſe we take away the Buds which bring a great deal of Fruit during ſix or ſeven years fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. When the little Branches, where the Buds are fixt, are fortified by the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Tree, it is then that we muſt no longer cut off with Sheers, neither Flowers nor Pears.</p>
                        <p>There are ſome who ſay, that we ought to cut Apricock, Nectarin and Peach-trees, four or five times a year, to wit, in <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi> in <hi>May,</hi> in <hi>June,</hi> and in <hi>July:</hi> but Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience has taught me, as well as Father <hi>Feüillant,</hi> who has writ of Fruit-trees, that theſe ſorts of Trees do not much love the knife; otherwiſe, they do not laſt long, and we deſtroy them in the end, by much cutting them: We are oblig'd in this Month to nale them up, and to cut at the ſame
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:154132:164"/>time the Branches which cannot be apply'd to the Eſpalier. Some preſerve them to be cut in the Month of <hi>February,</hi> according to the Maxim that theſe ſorts of Trees, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very nice, do not love to be cut, or rather, they pull away with the Finger the Branches, as faſt as they come againſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and in an Irregular place.</p>
                        <p>After the firſt Lopping of <hi>February,</hi> I am not of opinion that we ought to cut any thing from Apple-trees, or Plum-trees, or Cherry-trees, or Goosberry-trees, or Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal Quince-trees, or Spaniſh Pomegranate-trees, unleſs we take from theſe two laſt Trees ſome <hi>Prodigals,</hi> which ordinaly grow there, and which do not fill, nor embelliſh the Tree.</p>
                        <p>Tho' I reſolv'd to ſpeak here but of Lop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Trees, nevertheleſs it may be allow'd me to ſay ſomewhat curious concerning their watering, which contributes much to the abundance and greatneſs of their Fruit.</p>
                        <p>It will be proper in the Evening at Sun ſet, during the great heats of the Summer to ſprinkle with Water ſometimes the Branches and the Fruit of Trees with a <hi>Dutch</hi> Pump. The Tree will be greener, and the Fruit better ſupply'd with nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: it is far better to do ſo than to Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them at the Root; for this laſt wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering renders Peats unſavory, and of an ill
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:154132:164"/>taſte, whereas the firſt, anſwering to an Evening Rain, or the due of the Night, keeps the Tree ſupply'd with nouriſhment, which afterwards gives its Fruit the Juice, which is meat for them, for rendring them good and delicious.</p>
                        <p>For this we ought to Obſerve that the Water which we will make uſe of, ought to be drawn in the Morning, and to have been a little expos'd to the Sun, ſo that it ſhould not be cold in the Evening when we would uſe it: Moreover that the Pump has three or four little holes, that it may make the Water which iſſues from it to divide it ſelf into a Thouſand little drops. Finally, that we ought to place our ſelves at fifteen or twenty Foot from the Tree which we will Water.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> The Lopping of Fruit-trees at the end of <hi>July.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>WE ſaid in the foregoing Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that the ſecond Sap or ſhoot began in the middle of <hi>June,</hi> and ended at the end of <hi>July;</hi> and we ſay at preſent, that the third manifeſts it ſelf in the Month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and ſometimes in the Month of <hi>September</hi> according to the diſpoſition of the Air, and the difference of the ſeaſons: ſo that it is at the end of the ſecond Sap that we ought to meddle with Trees; for in the Month of <hi>Auguſt</hi> we muſt take good heed not to cut any thing there, and if we cut then any Branch, the Wound does not cicatrize it ſelf all the year, the heat drys it, and the approaching Winter incommodes it with the exceſs of its Rains and colds.</p>
                        <p>This Lopping is not performed but to cauſe the Branches to be fortified, to make the Flower-buds to fill themſelves, and to cauſe the Fruit to be nouriſht the more.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="43" facs="tcp:154132:165"/>If we ought to be ſcrupulous in the Month of <hi>June</hi> to Lop Trees, we ought to be ſo for a much greater reaſon this Month, for at preſent we muſt but pinch away with the nails the ends of, or cut a little ſome Branches.</p>
                        <p>We muſt chooſe then in <hi>July</hi> a fine day and the decreaſe of the Moon to viſit the Trees: and we muſt call to mind the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion which we have made of the Branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Trees.</p>
                        <p>We muſt Lop again at the ſecond knot the Prodigals a third time, if they have ſhot vigorouſly, that we may wound ſo often the Branch which receives much of Sap, that its divers Wounds may weaken it, and divert by this means the Sap to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, that it may be divided into many Branches. Theſe Prodigals come not much but in Trees Grafted on the Pear-tree; and Planted in a good Soil, as I have ſaid: and ſo we muſt not ſeek for them elſewhere, for thoſe which are Graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on the great Quince-tree do not ſhoot much: and in this Month we ought to cut nothing in theſe laſt ſorts of Trees.</p>
                        <p>In this Month we muſt not touch the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Branches, which we judg'd to be ſo in the Months of <hi>February</hi> and of <hi>June,</hi> we muſt ſtay till the Month of <hi>February</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing to Lop them, if they ought to be Lopt.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="44" facs="tcp:154132:166"/>Neither muſt we touch of thoſe which are Fertile: but concerning thoſe which iſſue from a Flower-bud which has faild, there are differing ſentiments. The ſhoot which iſſues from this Bud having been cut at the ſecond knot in the Month of <hi>June,</hi> ſhoots ſometimes at the ſecond Sap, and yields one or two Scions. Some will have it that we ſhould cut theſe alſo at the ſecond knot: becauſe they pretend that Nature ought to form there ſome diſpoſition to make Buds. Others Lop at the ſecond Eye the leaſt, and preſerve the faireſt and beſt fed and knotted, to ſee in <hi>February</hi> following if it will ſhew its Genius, and at that time they leave it all entire, becauſe it comes from a Fertile place, or cut it very long. They have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd by experience that three years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards it brings a great many Buds, whence iſſue an infinite number of Fruit.</p>
                        <p>If in this Month there are found ſome uſeleſs Branches beſides, they muſt be cut an Eye or two from the Mother-Branch, to make them ſhoot forth ſomewhat that is good.</p>
                        <p>There come often on Peach and Necta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin-trees, and ſometimes on Pear-trees a cluſter of Branches, which happens often to Trees grown old, and fit to be cut for renewing themſelves. We muſt do at this
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:154132:166"/>time as we did in the <hi>February</hi> before: that is to ſay, we muſt make choice of the Maſter Sprig to preſerve it, and cut away the others. Nevertheleſs there are ſome who ſtay till the Month of <hi>February</hi> enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to do this, becauſe that in <hi>July</hi> the heat penetrates to the quick into the Wounds of nice Trees; and beſides that which Trees ſhoot after this ſeaſon ought not to be preſerv'd. They cut therefore Trees at this time the leaſt they can, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying doubtleſs on experience which has obliged them ſo to do.</p>
                        <p>Toward Magdelan-tide, in the Decreaſe of the Moon, which happens in the Month of <hi>July,</hi> we muſt nail up again Peach-trees, Nectarin-trees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and we muſt cut all the Branches which are not flexible, and which are grown contrary to Order, tho' with this diligence, that we muſt cover as ſoon as may be with a Plaiſter, and paper the Wounds which have been there made.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe who are for the laſting of theſe Trees, pale them up at this time, but they ſtay to cut them till the Month of <hi>February;</hi> theſe ſorts of Trees (according to their ſentiment) being ſo nice, that they cannot endure the Summer, the great heat penetrating into their Wounds, cauſes five or ſix Eyes to dye. Which we perceive dryed the year following:
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:154132:167"/>this is the way (ſay they) to make them laſt forty years, as experience ſhews it. They choſe much rather (as I have ſaid) to pull away with the Finger, as they walk, the Branches which come contrary to order, than to cut them, and if there are found ſome which ought to be cut, they keep them for the Month of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi> following. Nevertheleſs, if they are too much confus'd, and that their ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow hinders the Sun from heating the Fruit, we ſhall be oblig'd to cut them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
                        <p>The abundance of Pears being ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily the Enemy of Eſpaliers, and making the Trees often dye, we muſt cut with Sheers the middle of the ſtalk of the Pears, to disburthen the Trees. This ought to be done when the Fruit is a quarter or a third part as big as it ought. This Rule is only for great Winter-Fruit, and chiefly for the <hi>Bon-Chretien:</hi> we muſt obſerve al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo not to leave above one or two Pears on a weak Branch, a ſtrong one being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to bear more.</p>
                        <p>Its alſo in this Month that Fruit enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Juice, and begin to take a colour through the light of the Sun: but becauſe often there are Leaves, which hinder the rayes fron touching the Fruit, care muſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in <hi>July</hi> to take away ſome from before
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:154132:167"/>them, and in the Month of <hi>Auguſt</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing we muſt cut away the reſt with Sheers, ſo managing the Light by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the burning heat of the Sun.</p>

                     <head type="sub">Of the uſe of the Fruits of Trees, for preſerving us in Health, or for Curing us when we are Sick.</head>
                     <p>IT is not enough for us to have Writ con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Lopping of Trees, to have Fruit in abundance, we muſt alſo teach the way and the time of eating them without being offended thereby.</p>
                     <p>If our Stomach were as good as that of our Fore-fathers, it would be uſeleſs for us to Write on this matter; but becauſe it is weakn'd by the pleaſures which men of late have taken in their way of living, there ſeems and Obligation upon us to give precepts concerning the uſe of Fruits, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for preſerving us in Health, or for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying our Diſeaſes when we are afflicted with them.</p>
                     <p>There is nothing ſo uſefull in Phyſick, as to know the qualities of things which we make uſe of in Life, either for avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:154132:170"/>thoſe which offend us, or for taking thoſe which do us good: it is what has o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blig'd Learned men to deliver their ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments concerning all that we eat, they making uſe always of Reaſon and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which we ſhall alſo follow in this Tract of <hi>The uſe of Fruits of Trees:</hi> for it is only of thoſe whereof we deſign to ſpeak.</p>
                     <p>We ſhall make therefore three different Chapters: We ſhall ſhew in the Firſt the time and the way of uſing thoſe Fruits which are eaſily corrupted, as <hi>Figgs, Nectarins, Peaches, Plums, Apricocks, Mulberries,</hi> and <hi>Cherries,</hi> which we ought always to eat faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, on an empty Stomach, and before Meals.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond ſhall Treat of thoſe which are not eaſily corrupted, and which we ought to eat the laſt thing after Meals, as <hi>Pears, Apples, Portugal Quinces, Medlars,</hi> and <hi>Services.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laſtly, the third ſhall explain how we may eat before or after Meals <hi>Raiſins, Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal and China Oranges, Spaniſh Pomegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates,</hi> and <hi>Corands.</hi> But before I enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this matter, I think fit to lay down ſome general Maxims, without which we cannot know the good uſe which we ought to make of Fruits.</p>
                     <p>We ought then in the firſt place to obſerve all the qualities of the Fruits before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:154132:171"/>that we may uſe the one and the others at divers times, according to the precepts which we ſhall give in the Sequel.</p>
                     <p>We find of Sweet, of Sugar'd, of Amber'd, of Musked, of Vinous, of Aqueous or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipid, of Sharp, of Acerb, and of Auſtere, and to ſpeak in a few words, there are of ſweet, ſharp, and auſtere.</p>
                     <p>There are found moreover of Red, of Yellow, of Green, of Tawny, of Violet, of White and of Black.</p>
                     <p>Again there are of <hi>Caſſans</hi> or harſh, of <hi>Burez,</hi> of Fondans or melting and tender; fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally we find ſuch as paſs quickly through the Bowels of thoſe that eat them, and theſe are the Fruits which are eaſily corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: there are others which ſtay a long time in the Stomach, and they are thoſe which are corrupted with difficulty.</p>
                     <p>All the Fruits whereof we deſign to ſpeak in particular, cool and moiſten much, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are but Water gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and paſſed through the Trunk of the Tree, which produces them; but neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs with this difference, that there are ſome colder and moiſter than others.</p>
                     <p>Fruit that have a quality which is ſweet, and pleaſant to the taſte, are leſs cold than others: thus, tho' Figgs, Raiſins, the <hi>Bon-Chrêtien,</hi> the Spaniſh Renet, and other Fruit of the like nature, moiſten much, they have
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:154132:171"/>nevertheleſs but a coldneſs, which does not paſs the bounds of the firſt degree, its for this reaſon that they dulcifie much, and that they nouriſh a little more than the others, their matter having more affinity with our parts. But if with their natural ſweetneſs they have an odour of Amber or of Musk, then they have I know not what ſubtle and penetrating parts, which exhilerate our Heart and Brain, and which make us di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt them better than others.</p>
                     <p>Sharp Fruit cool more than ſweet: but they do not moiſten ſo much, they power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully penetrate and attenuate the thick and earthy matters, ſo that afterward they are no longer capable of doing us hurt. They qualifie our heated Bowels; they deſtroy the Flame there, which often all the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Phyſick have not been able to quench during many Months: they cool our Liver, remove all the Obſtructions of our Bowels, and give our Blood a more free motion: finally they appeaſe fluxions, if we apply them outwardly, and they ſtay a Flux of Blood from whatever part it comes.</p>
                     <p>Fruits which are auſtere and acerb, and which differ but in more or leſs, reſtringe the Tongue and the Palate when we eat them: it ſeems that they ſtop the Orifices of the threads that terminate there, by the blunted and obtuſe particles of their matter.</p>

                        <pb n="54" facs="tcp:154132:173"/>I do not pretend to ſpeak here of Fruit which are not Ripe, that have all theſe qualities. I baniſh them entirely from this Book as very pernicious to the Life of Man; but I ſpeak only of thoſe, which being in a perfect maturity, retain ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of auſtere, acerb, or aſtringent, as the Rake Pear, the great Dégue, the Quince, and other Fruits of the like Nature. All theſe Fruits are alſo more cold than the ſweet and the Amb'red, but they do not moiſten ſo much: and becauſe their ſavour is in a more Earthy matter, ev'n in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect they do not penetrate ſo much as the Sharp. They reſtring however the Stomach and the Bowels, and withſtand a Looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and a <hi>Diſſentery,</hi> and being apply'd outwardly they hinder Vomiting, retard growing Inflammations, and eaſily cicatrize the Skin, which has been open'd by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Wound.</p>
                     <p>After all, a Fruit which has been brought to perfection by the heat of the Sun, and which has not been ſhadowed by the Leaves of its Tree, will be always of better taſte than another. A red Apple or Pear, and a yellow Raiſin will always be better than others; becauſe their Juice will be better digeſted, and their uſeleſs moiſture will be eaſily evaporated by the heat of the Sun.</p>
                     <p>You muſt obſerve in the ſecond place,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:154132:173"/>that I give not here precepts concerning the uſe of Fruits, for ſound and robuſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, on whom Fruits make no Impreſſion; Let ſuch eat of them at all times, and as much as they pleaſe, without diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Nature and Temperament, they will not find any inconvenience: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe ſorts of Perſons are very rare, and that in the Age we Live, there are more Valetudinarians than others, I may be allow'd to Write only for thoſe who have their Entrals tender, and who are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten incommoded by eating Fruits.</p>
                     <p>The greateſt part of men at preſent are of a hot and dry Complexion; we have all of us the inward parts very hot, through the exceſs of a burnt Choler, and through the redundancy of a troubled Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. With difficulty are we able during the Summer to ſupport the heat of the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, without being exhauſted of our ſtrength: We have the Stomach ſo weak and ſo tender through our natural diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature, that we have need of much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution for the good uſe of Fruits.</p>
                     <p>In the third place, we muſt remember, that in walking in a Garden full of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Fruit, which are perfectly Ripe; we muſt not eat one which has not firſt been waſht with freſh Water, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

                        </gap>s which we call putrid, which always begin with ſhiverings and tremblings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all the Juices of Fruits being then through the heat of the day, and of the Seaſon in a conſiderable motion, they cauſe in our Stomach ſo great a diſorder at the time that the fermentation is there made, that the Chyle becoming crude and undigeſted, often gives Birth to great Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, whereas the motion of the Juice of Fruits being calm'd by the cold of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of the Night or of the ſeaſon, the Fruits make no diſorder in our Stomach, which then digeſts them better, and which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms its Office much better, when it is not interrupted by unuſual cauſes.</p>
                     <p>After all, we ought to know that our ſood being in ſome ſort like our ſubſtance, changes it ſelf eaſily within our parts im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptibly to us: Its thus that Bread, Fleſh, an Egg, have no Predominant quality when we put them into our Mouth, and we do not ſenſibly feel the Vertues when we have them in the Stomach. We muſt not ſay ſo of Aliments which we call medicamental; they nouriſh little, and on the other ſide they
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:154132:174"/>have ſenſible qualities, which affect our Tongue and our Palate. We may perceive that a <hi>Vertelongue,</hi> or a <hi>Pear Portail</hi> will cool and moiſten our heated Stomach, that it will qualifie the Gall of our Liver, and the heat of our Reins, and that by cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this laſt part, it will hinder Stones from being form'd there.</p>
                     <p>Finally, its a grand ſecret for our good Health, to keep what we eat, from corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the Stomach. The things of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Nature which we put into it, daily cauſe diſorders, whereof our ſelves are too often Witneſſes; if experience did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us of this truth, there would doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs be a great deal of pleaſure in eating many things one after the other; but it ſhews us that eating before or after Meals Fruits of a different Nature, that is to ſay, ſuch as are eaſily corrupted, as Peaches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſuch as have a more firm ſubſtance, as Pears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Coction which is made in the Stomach is not laudable, and that it is thence that often proceeds the little Health of thoſe who over looſly indulge themſelves to the pleaſure of the taſte.</p>
                     <p>If therefore we eat at the end of Meals Peaches and Pears, as it often happens, the Peaches being of a ſubſtance to be ſoon digeſted, and to paſs off quickly, and the Pears of a pretty firm matter, requiring more
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:154132:175"/>time to Concoct, two great inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies follow; the firſt, that the Peaches trouble the Belly, and make the Food taken at the Meal to deſcend, without being ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly digeſted: the ſecond, that they haſtily drag along with them the Pears, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a longer time for digeſtion, and thus there comes of it but crudities, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward obſtructions, which are the cauſe of ſome troubleſome Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>It is not the ſame when we eat before Meals Mulberries and Peaches, or after Meals Pears and Quinces; the two firſt Fruits and the two laſt have a matter and qualities near alike: the former paſs quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through the Belly by reaſon of their great humidity: and the later digeſt themſelves afterward at leaſure, by conſtringing after the Meal the ſuperior Orifice of the Stomach, which by this means acquits it ſelf much better of its office.</p>

                        <p>I Say in the firſt place that good Fruit which are Ripe, never do hurt, unleſs we miſuſe them, or commit faults in eating them; there are none but ill and unripe Fruit which cauſe Crudities, Indigeſtions, Colicks, and Fevers. I ſay much more; experience daily teaches us, that by the moderate uſe of them we prevent an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of Diſeaſes, and that we Cure as many. Our Gardens fail not of Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to relieve us, and I wonder we go ſo far into Forrein Countrys to ſeek for Drogues, which are muſty or rotten, when they are brought to us, ſince we have ſo excellent at home. Our Fruits have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more Vertues and Charms than all thoſe Diogues, and there are ſeen few Perſons who refuſe Peaches, Mulberrys, or Pears, to appeaſe the burning of the Bowels; Whereas we daily ſee Perſons have in hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror

                        <p>Becauſe I am oblig'd to follow the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which I have preſcribed to my ſelf, I ſhall treat in this Chapter of the good uſe of thoſe Fruits which ought to be eaten at Break-faſt, or before Meals: and I ſhall begin with Figgs, which among all Fruits have always been the moſt eſteem'd.</p>

                           <p>A Mong all the Food wherewith Men nouriſh'd themſelves at the beginning of the World, there is not one which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves a greater praiſe than Figgs. The Ancients have made Encomiums on them in many of their Books; and the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians</hi> ſo far eſteem'd them, that they would never go to any Feaſt where they were not provided in a great plenty. Alſo ſome have compar'd them to Gold, nay have eſteem'd them far better than this Mettal. Its doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:154132:176"/>by reaſon of their ſugary ſweeteſs, which is the Symbol of peace, that men former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſht their Friends a happy year, by ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them at the beginning of it Figgs and Honey.</p>
                           <p>In truth, they have admirable Vertues in Caſe they are eaten with Bread, for Break-faſt, or before Meals. For it is thus that they qualifie the Bowels, and that they appeaſe the exceſs of a troubleſome heat. They do not fail of producing other good effects, they quench drought, lenify the Breaſt, and give a more eaſy reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. They clear the Liver and the Spleen of the Obſtructions wherewith they are afflicted. They diſcharge the Reins and the Bladder of their ſlime and Gravel: They looſen the Belly, be it never ſo tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: finally they nouriſh and fatten both together, witneſs the famous Wraſtlers, who perform'd moſt couragiouſly, when they liv'd but of Bread and Figgs. Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs alſo the Keepers of Figg-Gardens, who (according to the Relation of <hi>Galen</hi>) ate in a manner nought but Figgs, and who in the mean while were ſo fat, that a man would have ſaid that nothing was wanting to them in their way of living.</p>
                           <p>Figgs alſo have this peculiar to them, that they contribute to the vigour of young People, and to the Health of ſuch
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:154132:177"/>as are Old, ſo that thoſe who uſe of them often, have no Wrinkles in their Face. A better Reaſon cannot be given than that Figgs, by their fat ſubſtance engender a Blood which dulcifies much, and this ſame matter being carried to the ſuperficies of the Body is there clear'd as well as the Blood of all its ſerous and ſuperfluous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, ſo that what remains ſerves as a natural Paint, and renders the Face ſmooth, and free from all ſorts of Wrinkles.</p>
                           <p>After all, they have the property of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating, Cleanſing and Digeſting; for no man doubts but they are hot in the firſt degree, and moiſt in the ſecond; the great humidity they have make them ſoon cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, and obliges us to eat them with Bread before Meals; for its the Leaven of the Bread which corrects all the ill qualities.</p>
                           <p>Its a Maxim among Phyſicians, That we ought always to begin with the things that are moiſteſt and eaſieſt of digeſtion, when we Dine, or when we Sup. And this is alſo another, That after Fruits that are Sweet and Luſcious, and which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all paſs quickly through the Belly, we ought rather to Drink pure Water, or Water mixt with a little Wine, than Wine alone. Pure Wine carrys haſtily into the Lacteal Veins the matter of the Figgs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be digeſted, and ſo cauſes winds, and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:154132:177"/>Indigeſtions in thoſe who ſo do: Whereas Water is the cauſe of a ſlower fermentation, by the means of which the Figgs are perfectly digeſted and make afterward a very lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Blood, which eaſily becomes our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
                           <p>They are not proper only for ſuch as are in Health, but likewiſe for thoſe who have a Fever and are coſtive, and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagine to my ſelf that a Learned Phyſitian can refuſe his Patient a Figg half dryed on the Tree by the heat of the Sun.</p>
                           <p>Dry Figgs have much more Vertue than thoſe which we gather; we may eat of them ev'n after Meals, without offence; alſo they are more penetrating and hotter than the others through the ſubtilty of their parts, but they are not ſo moiſt. If they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd in the form of a Cataplaſm with Bread and a little Vinegar, haply they are the quickeſt and moſt certain remedy for open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an abſceſs, for killing a Carbuncle, or the ſwelling of the Kings-Evil, or laſtly to withſtand the progreſs of a Latent Cancer.</p>
                           <p>They do much more, if we will believe <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> for they tear from the Fleſh (as we may ſay) a piece of a Bone broken, if we mix them with wild Popy Flowers.</p>
                           <p>The German Phyſicians have not found a better remedy in the Small-pox, or Meaſles than the decoction of theſe Fruits
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:154132:178"/>dry; experience has ſhewn them that this decoction, by Purging by Urine, carrys a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all the Malignant ſeroſity which is the cauſe of thoſe troubleſome Diſeaſes.</p>
                           <p>But among all the good qualities which theſe Fruits enjoy, there are obſerv'd ſome ill: they cauſe Winds which ſwell the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach; they breed Lice, and makes us fond in careſſing Women.</p>
                           <p>The Spirits irritated and ſet in motion by the Winds which they engender, and a viſcous humidity which they cauſe, are two things which diſpoſe us to be fond of a Woman, as we have prov'd at larg in a Diſſertation we caus'd to be Printed the laſt year; which has for Title, <hi>Whether thoſe who Drink Water alone are more amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous than others?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Lice which they ſay Figgs breed in thoſe who uſe them in exceſs, proceed but from the filth of the Skin, and from our excrements which they evacuate by the pores: and the evils they cauſe in us by the Winds they engender, proceed but from the ill uſe we make of them; if we eat them with Nuts or Almonds, we ſhall correct all the diſorders they can bring us; and I can aſſure you that being ſo eaten, they will be without fault, and will do us no hurt, ſtill provided that we uſe them with moderation.</p>

                           <p>I Cannot bear the contempt ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have for <hi>Nectarins, Alberges, Brug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, Melicotonys, Perſes</hi> and <hi>Peaches,</hi> nor be ſatisfied with the reaſon they bring for blaming them. They ſay among other things that theſe Fruits are corrupted ſo eaſily in the Stomach, that it is almoſt impoſſible to ſecure them from it; that they produce ill Blood, that they cauſe Fevers; that they injure the inward parts; that the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> from whoſe Country they were brought, dare not eat of them by reaſon of their Malignity, and finally that <hi>Galen,</hi> the moſt knowing of the Greek Phyſitians, always condemn'd them.</p>
                           <p>But if it were free for me to explain my ſelf at large thereon, and to break off the deſign which I propos'd to my ſelf; I would ſhew that the ill uſe which is made of the moſt excellent things, is often the cauſe that they are deſpis'd and blam'd.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:154132:179"/>Peaches, not to ſpeak of the other kinds, are a Fruit ſo excellent and ſo delicious to the taſte, that I could freely prefer them before Figgs and Raiſins, which (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſentiment of ſome) ought to hold the firſt rank among Fruits.</p>
                           <p>Very far from cauſing all the evils where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they are accus'd, they cool the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach when heated, quench the heat of the Liver, allay the burning of the Blood du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the extremity of the Summer heats, and moiſten the matter which is then very thick through the drought of the Seaſon.</p>
                           <p>If we obſerve well their praecautions, they do not corrupt in the Stomach, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that they are eaten before Meals, and that after having eaten them we drink only Water, if we find a burning in the Bowels; or excellent Wine, if we find our ſelves to have a very moderate heat; It is then that they will engender a better Blood than the Herbs we uſe every day.</p>
                           <p>I own that in <hi>Perſia</hi> theſe ſorts of Fruits have Malignant and purgative qualities, but ſince the Trees were tranſported into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and have been re-planted in <hi>Italy,</hi> and ſince cultivated in <hi>France,</hi> they have loſt all the Malignity which they had, and have retain'd but the purgative Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which they have ſtill, and which they Communicate to their Fruit.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="67" facs="tcp:154132:179"/>Its this purgative Vertue which cauſes them to be ſo much eſteem'd of by the Healthy and Valetudinarians, who had much rather eat faſting four or five excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Peaches, and drink after them Water or Wine, to looſen the Belly; than to take a doſe of Phyſick, the very name of which raiſes a horrour in thoſe that take it the moſt couragiouſly.</p>
                           <p>Its this ſame property which reſides in the Leaves, the Flowers and the Fruit of the Peach-tree, which kills the Worms in the Bowels, which Purges Choler and the Seroſities of the Body, and ſtops ev'n Vomitings at Sea, as we ſee written in the Works of <hi>Julius</hi> of <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>If <hi>Galen</hi> had Liv'd in our days, and had taſted Peaches, which the Art and Induſtry of our Gardiners have rendred ſo recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, I am certain he would have had quite another opinion of theſe ſorts of Fruit: the Peaches which were carryed to <hi>Rome</hi> in the Time of this Phyſitian, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Sea from <hi>Sicily</hi> or from about <hi>Naples,</hi> were partly rotted before they came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which made <hi>Galen</hi> at that time to deſpiſe them, and to condemn them ev'n as a Food very pernicious for Man.</p>
                           <p>Some Perſons will correct the ill quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the great humidity of the Peach; by eating it with Bread, by expoſing it
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:154132:180"/>two or three days to the ſcorching heat of the Sun, by eating its Kernel, or finally by drinking pure Wine with it.</p>
                           <p>True it is, experience has taught me, that Bread eaten with Fruits which we ought to uſe before Meals, corrects their ill qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and that by expoſing Peaches to the Sun, they loſe a ſuperfluous humidity which often incommodes us. But the ſame experience has alſo given me to underſtand, that Peach and Apricock Kernels much charge the Stomach, and that beſides their great bitterneſs they are alſo very difficult to digeſt: that moreover, tho' pure Wine be the ſole thing which oppoſes it ſelf to the coldneſs, and humidity of this Fruit; nevertheleſs if we drink much of ſuch as is ſmall or of a mean ſtrength, we fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Vomitings and Looſneſſes, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times degenerate into a Bloody-Flux. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as a little of excellent pure Wine corrects by its noble heat the ill qualities of the Peach: Its haply this experiment which gave occaſion for this Latine Verſe.</p>

                           <p>The ſweet Plum rejoyces a hot Stomach, lenifies the Breaſt, Looſen's the Belly, and nouriſhes much more than the Peach, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided however that it be eaten before Meals, otherwiſe it corrupts, and by moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning too much the ſuperiour Orifice of the Stomach after Meals, it makes the Food de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend too ſoon, and ſo cauſes Crudities, which it is difficult afterward to deal with.</p>

Its doubtleſs in order to be more cooled, and more moiſtn'd, and to keep the Belly more ſoluble that ſome Men eat often Prunes with their Meat, and that there are ev'n ſome who diſlike their Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage if it has not of them.</p>

                           <p>OF all the Fruits that are eaten there are none but Mulberries which are fit for Men when unripe: theſe ought only to be Red, drawing toward the Black, to be eaten. If they are throughly ripe, they corrupt ſo haſtily in the Stomach, that ſhortly after they cauſe in thoſe who eat freely of them, Diſtempers of the Stomach, Looſneſſes, Carbuncles, Malignant Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and often pernicious and Epidemick Diſeaſes, eſpecially if Rains have been rife during the Summer.</p>
                           <p>There is nothing which changes it ſelf ſooner into Choler, and which becomes ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er poyſon within our Body than a Black Mulberry. Thoſe who have the Stomach foul ought to take good heed of eating them, unleſs they have a mind to be ſick in a ſhort time. The Red-blacks withſtand Corruption more, and tho' they are very moiſt, they have nevertheleſs I know not
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:154132:182"/>what of drought through their ſharpneſs and aſtriction, which hinders them from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting ſo ſoon.</p>
                           <p>To uſe them well, we ought neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to mind the praecautions belonging to them, and never to eat of them but when the Stomach is empty, clean, and hot; for if a heat be not felt in the Bowels, how young and Cholerick ſoever a Perſon be, I do not adviſe him to eat of them, unleſs he has a mind to fall into ſome one of the Diſeaſes which we have ſpoken of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                           <p>Mulberries carry their Liquor with them, and nothing ought to be Drank after they are eaten; they excite the appetite, cool the Stomach, appeaſe drought, allay the heat of the Liver, Purge the Blood of its ſuperfluous ſeroſities, carrying them off by Urine. They blunt the edg of the Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, moiſten thoſe that are troubled with Melancholy and Choler: finally they make the Belly ſoluble in thoſe who are natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Coſtive. I will ſay much more, if Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries gather'd from the Tree and eaten in a good plenty can cauſe the Bloody-flux; as we ſee it every year, nature which moſt commonly has plac't the remedy in the cauſe of our evils, has not forgotten to teach us by experience, that theſe Fruits ſerve for an aſſured remedy againſt the invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate

                           <p>Since the chief Vertue of Mulberryes is to cool and to keep the Maſs of Blood from fermenting, by qualifying the parts which ſerve for ſanguification, there may be cauſe to believe that they may be a Remedy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to the Gout as well as all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fruits. For the pain which Gouty Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons feel in the ligaments of their Joints, is caus'd but by a Blood and a ſeroſity too ſharp, which ſharpneſs is blunted by the great humidity of Mulberries, they inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly evacuating it by Urine. We need not ſeek for other proofs than daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and that which <hi>Hegeſander</hi> has left us in Writing. He relates that the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry-trees did not bear Fruit for Twenty years together, and that during all that time Men, Women, and Children, were ſo trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the Gour, that other cauſes could not be then diſcover'd, than the ſcarcity of theſe Fruit.</p>

                           <p>SHarp Fruits in general are enemies to Old and Melancholick Perſons, when they do not find within themſelves an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive heat; they are not edulcorated in their Stomach (if I may ſo call it) and are diſtributed into their Veins without being Concocted and blunted. Which is not done without cauſing in the Mouth little ſharp belchings, and in the Stomach trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome prickings, and in the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy an inſupportable heavyneſs.</p>
                           <p>It does not happen ſo to young Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that are Sanguine and Cholerick who have the Entrals heated: but if caſually the ſharpneſs of Cherries with ſhort Stems eaten faſting, cauſes ſometimes in theſe prickings in the Stomach, they need then but to mix Powder Sugar with them, to blunt the point of it.</p>
                           <p>The moſt refined Sugar and the whiteſt, which we call Royal, is the leaſt proper for
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:154132:183"/>the uſe of Man; it heats and drys us too much, and through the abundance of its Sulphur and Salt, it is entirely oppoſite to the principles of our Life: The finer Sugar is the leſs ſweet it is, and the leſs alſo it quenches thirſt. Lime which is a capital Enemy of Man, if it be taken inwardly, or outwardly apply'd, is the chief matter which Refiners make uſe of, for rendring Sugar whiter and more ſolid; and tho' Powder Sugar be made by many repeated Lixivium's, nevertheleſs it ought always to be preferr'd before Loaf Sugar, and if we will chooſe the beſt of all, we muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways take that which is the whiteſt among the browns. It is that which is extremely ſweet, which quenches thirſt, which moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, and which lenifies the Breaſt: I thought it proper to make this digreſſion for Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who loveſweet things, becauſe Sugar is often ſet at our Tables, for rendring our Fruits more agreeable to the taſte.</p>
                           <p>Sharp Cherryes exhilerate the Stomach, they excite there the Appetite, and appeaſe the drought. They diſſipate the thick hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and by their ſharp quality, they cut them (as I may ſay) and divide them, either that they may ſerve afterward for Food, or be evacuated with more eaſe.</p>
                           <p>By all theſe Vertues they are very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per as well as Mulberries, to oppoſe the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:154132:184"/>cauſe and the progreſs of the Gout, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience ſhews us that Gouty Perſons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a ſenſible relief by the uſe of Fruits, which qualify the Liver, and which cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the Acrimony of the Blood.</p>
                           <p>Moreover they powerfully looſen the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if they are freely eaten faſting while the Dew is yet on the Fruit; and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience teaches us every year that they carry off by a Looſneſs long Diſeaſes, which all the other Remedies of Phyſick have not been able to Cure.</p>
                           <p>The moſt proper time to eat them is in the Morning faſting, either with or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Bread. They have moiſture enough to oblige us not to drink any Liquor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them. As for the lateward Cherries which we call at <hi>Rochelle des Guignes</hi> with long Stems, tho' they may be eaten be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Meals; nevertheleſs I allow them to be eaten after Meals: they have an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Aſtriction, which contributes to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, and which cloſes the ſuperiour O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifice of the Stomach, that it performs its Office afterward much better.</p>
                           <p>The ſweet Cherries, eſpecially thoſe which we call in this Town <hi>Guindoux</hi> and <hi>Guigneaux,</hi> are much better than the ſharp for old Perſons and for theſe who have a nice Stomach; they do not prick ſo much the inward parts, and they nouriſh more.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="77" facs="tcp:154132:184"/>Haply there is not any Remedy more agreeable and more excellent for qualify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Reins, and for clearing thence the Gravel, Slime, and little Stones, than the Wine of ſharp Cherries: We muſt take off them therefore in the Months of <hi>June</hi> or <hi>July,</hi> twelve or fifteen Pounds, we muſt cleanſe them of their Stems and Stones, and caſt them and their Stones broken through the Bung-hole of a Barrel, <hi>(a Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel containing ſomewhat more than our Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel)</hi> of good White-wine.

                           <head>ART. I. <hi>Of Pears.</hi>
                           </head>
                           <p>NEver has the Induſtry of our Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners appear'd more admirable than in the divers kinds of Pears which we have in <hi>France.</hi> They have taken a particular care to Sow Seeds, and to preſerve ſuch Trees, as in their Wood and Leaves gave them marks of a good hope: For as by Sowing a great many Flower Seeds, there come of all kinds, and ev'n ſome that are beautiful and double, ſo by Sowing a great ſtore of Pear Kernels, it ſeems that Nature pleaſes her ſelf in giving us a grand varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Pear-trees, which produce all new Fruits, and ſome of them delicious to the taſte: haply it is becauſe the Pear is the moſt excellent Fruit of all, that ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in multiplying its kinds ev'n to an infinite number: It is thus that the <hi>Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Jean,</hi> the <hi>Dame Houdote,</hi> or the <hi>Amadote,</hi> the <hi>Gabriel Egand,</hi> the <hi>Micet,</hi> the <hi>Martin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,</hi> and a great many other excellent Pears
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:154132:186"/>are come of Kernels, and that they have had the honour to bear the Names of thoſe who rais'd them.</p>
                           <p>But not to ſtop at this Diſcourſe, which ſeems to contribute nothing to my deſign, I may ſay that the artifice of our Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners has multiplyed for us Pears of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, of Autumn and of Winter; that it has given us more of <hi>Caſſantes</hi> and of <hi>Burez,</hi> that it has ſhewn us more of Sweet, of ſharp and of Acerb, and that finally it has procur'd for us more of Vinous, of Ambred and of Musked, than we had before.</p>
                           <p>Among all theſe Pears the ſweet and melting are eſteem'd the beſt, they nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh more than the others which are a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſharp or Acerb, and they are much more friendly to the nature of Man. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs there are ſome who prefer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe firſt Pears the Sweet and <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>s,</hi> becauſe theſe for the moſt part are odoriferous, and the others are not. They priſe therefore much more the <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chretien-Pioulier,</hi> or the great <hi>Winter Musk Pear,</hi> than the <hi>Vergoulette,</hi> or the <hi>Bergamot</hi> of Autumn.</p>
                           <p>Be it how it will, the Pear in general cools and moiſtens the heated Entrals, and by its gentle Aſtriction contributes much to the Concoction of the Stomach, by gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly cloſing its ſuperiour Orifice, and by
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:154132:186"/>Looſning a little the Belly; its the reaſon for which it ought always to be eaten af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Meals, for if it be eaten the Stomach being empty, it cumbers us, and loads us much, and moreover it binds the Belly; but however we eat of it after Meals, it always has very good effects, provided that we have the Stomach diſpos'd to receive it: for be it that we eat it Crud, or Baked, or Roſted, or Boyl'd, with Powder Sugar and Cinnamon, as old People ought to eat it, after all theſe manners it always ſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the Stomach drain'd of its ſtrength and weaken'd by the exceſs of heat.</p>
                           <p>That which is to be Obſerv'd in the uſe of Pears, is, that after Meals we ought to eat fewer Beurees than Caffantes, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer being more digeſted, and more ready to corrupt through the leaſt fault that we commit in our way of living. Moreover we ought always to make choice of the moſt coloured, and reject thoſe which we find Worm eaten. Finally we ought after Pears to drink a good Cup of pure Wine, letting this Latin Maxim have its force, <hi>Poſt Crudum, merum.</hi> But above all we ought to remember not to drink much Wine, nor to drink ſuch as is ſmall; ſmall Wine through its defect of heat not cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Pear to be Concocted, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſing crudities by its redundancy,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:154132:187"/>make both of them diſorders in a Stomach the moſt ev'n tempered and the moſt ſtrong. It is what experience ſhew'd us not long ſince in a Perſon, who fell into inſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pains, having drank much Wine; and <hi>Rodolphus Goclenius</hi> aſſures us, that another dyed having drank much Beer, both, after having eaten Pears to an exceſs.</p>
                           <p>Becauſe our Stomach is much hotter in Winter than in Summer, our heat not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipating it ſelf during that firſt ſeaſon through the pores of our Body, there are Perſons who rather eat Pears in Winter than in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and who do not find themſelves ſo much incommoded by them. Haply theſe Pears have ſweated in the heap, and have there ſeaſon'd themſelves; whereas the Pears of the Summer, having their Sap ſtill in motion, and having not loſt their ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous humidity, trouble rather the Coction of the Stomach than the Pears of Winter.</p>

                           </head>
                           <p>SInce Apple-trees have been cultivated in the <hi>Pais des Baſques,</hi> and in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Normandy,</hi> Men have had a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eſteem for their Fruits. Trees have been Sown, and afterward Grafted; they have been after that planted and re-planted: Finally they have been ſo often chang'd in their Soil, Countrys, and Climats, that the Fruit are become ſweet and pleaſant.</p>
                           <p>I own that Apples were a long time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpis'd, and that in <hi>Arabia</hi> they have ev'n been accus'd of Contributing to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zick, and to the drying of the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. It has been ſaid alſo that they caus'd weakneſs in the Joints, and that conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they increaſt the Gout and other Flux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, that they engendred Worms in the Bowels, and that finally they caus'd Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigo's, as experience ſhews it us, and as it happen'd formerly to <hi>Scipio Gentilis</hi> a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:154132:188"/>Civilian, who after Meals abus'd theſe ſorts of Fruits.</p>
                           <p>But if Men have talkt after this manner, either it has been becauſe they knew not Apples well, and that they have been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for other Fruit, or they judg'd of them, as Men do of all other things, by the ill ſucceſs of thoſe who have abus'd them: for if we will examine the thing very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly, we ſhall find that the <hi>Arabians</hi> had none but Apples that were wild, acerb and very unpleaſant to the taſte; that the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Joints, the Worms of the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, and the Vertigo's are caus'd but by the exceſſes which are committed with them, or by the ill praecautions that are taken in their uſe.</p>
                           <p>On the contrary, Apples which are ſweet and Luſcious, Odoriferous and firm, exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate the Heart, and allay the exceſs of its beat; they correct the Gall of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, they dilute the Blood, which is too thick and groſs: in a word they cool and moiſten the heated Viſcera: Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, whatſoever is ſaid, they oppoſe the drying of the Body and the Ptiſick, and we ſee but very few of theſe ſorts of evils where Cyder is common: For this drink is friendly to the Stomach, which it heats in a moderate way; it revives the Heart, and opens the Obſtructions of the Entrals:
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:154132:188"/>In a word it is of wonderfull uſe to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick and atrabilarious Perſons; that which iſſues the firſt from Apples ſquees'd in a Preſs is not ſo excellent as the ſecond: and the third reſembles the <hi>Demy-wine</hi> of our Peaſants.</p>
                           <p>If we mix among Apples a little Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Sugar, they make us ſpit, and cool our Breaſt.</p>
                           <p>But they muſt be us'd with precaution, that is to ſay, that they muſt be eaten after Meals, becauſe they are heavy and difficult to digeſt, that they ought to be forbidden Old People, unleſs they find themſelves heated, or that they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd as Pears with Powder Sugar, Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon and Water, and that finally we ought to drink a little of good Pure Wine after having eaten them.</p>
                           <p>In the Diſtempers which are accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a conſiderable heat and drought, they give a great relief, if we eat a little of them Crud, or Boyl'd, or that we put of them in Water: and I wonder that in <hi>France</hi> we give our ſelves ſo much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in ſeeking Oranges and Citrons for our: Diſeaſes, when we have a <hi>ſhort-ſtart Apple</hi> or a <hi>Spaniſh Rennet:</hi> Haply things which coſt much, and are often difficult to be had, are much better than the common, and that they much more ſatisfy the mind of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:154132:189"/>the Diſeaſed; for it is this part which we ought often to Cure in thoſe who find themſelves ill.</p>
                           <p>Finally, Apples do not profit us only by taking them at the Mouth, they are a ſovereign Remedy for Heart-burnings and for the heats of the Stomach if they are outwardly applied: for if a Cataplaſm be made of Boyl'd Apples, and apply'd hot on the Region of the Heart, or on the pit of the Stomach, haply we may not find an Epithem more Sovereign in thoſe Caſes. Alſo experience has ſhewn us that the pulp of a boyl'd Apple put hot on Blood-ſhed and inflam'd Eyes, is almoſt the only Remedy for this evil.</p>

                           <p>
                              <hi>Quinces</hi> are cold and dry, they reſtringe alſo manifeſtly the parts of the Body where they are apply'd; and 'tis by this aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent quality, that conſtringing the Stomach in the upper part, and afterward the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines, after that they are eaten, they ſqueeſe, and force out all they meet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their cavity, be it Excrement, Choler or Phlegm. Its what happend to an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> of whom <hi>Galen</hi> ſpeaks, who was pleaſantly Purg'd after having
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:154132:190"/>eaten Quinces after a Meal, and having walkt a little upon it: ſo that after all the experiments that we have had of them, we ought no longer to doubt of their Vertues.</p>
                           <p>Mean while the ſtirring of the Belly which they cauſe, does not happen but to Perſons who have the Stomach weak and nice, and who have need by reaſon of this to fortifie it; for theſe Fruits do not work the ſame effects in a young ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſt Man; and on the other ſide, if they are eaten before Meals, being very far from moving the Belly, they make it tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and it is ſo that thoſe do who have it ordinarily too moiſt.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Quinces</hi> have alſo other excellent Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; if they are eaten Crud, Boyl'd, or preſerv'd with Sugar, they give an appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, they ſtop a Looſneſs, appeaſe Vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, withſtand an old Dyſentery and a Bloody-Flux; and if weſcrape off them Crud, and put the pulp of them hot on the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the Heart in the form of an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theme, when a Malignant Fever attacks us, they contribute not a little toward the ſubduing it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Their penetrating and ſweet odour revives the Heart and the Brain, and it has not been heard ſaid hitherto, that Quinces corrupt in the Stomach.</p>
                           <p>I very much approve the method which
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:154132:190"/>ſome have of making Wine and Water of Quinces. Theſe two Drinks have near the ſame Vertues, unleſs it be that the Water is moſt proper for thoſe who find themſelves much heated, and the Wine more meet for thoſe who do not find a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny praedominant quality, and who are old or Phlegmatick.</p>

                              </gap>, is made after this manner.

                           <p>The Wine is made after this manner; we take at Vintage time Ten or Twelve Pounds of Portugal Quinces, prepar'd after the ſame manner as I have ſaid, we throw them into fifty or ſixty pints of good Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret <hi>Muſt,</hi> and after that they have wrought for thirty days, we ſtrain the Liquor, we put it into another Veſſel which we ſtop

                           <p>Theſe two Drinks produce good effects in Perſons who uſe of them; they fortify the inward parts, oppoſe a Looſneſs and a Dyſentery, cleanſe the Reins of their filth, hinder the Vapour of Wine from offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Head, and ſecure us from Peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Vapours: Finally, they cauſe ſo many good effects, that I muſt paſs the bounds of an abſtract if I would name them all</p>

                              <hi>ART. IV.</hi> Of Medlars and Services.</head>
                           <p>THeſe Fruits are ſeldom at our Tables, and they are eaten moſt commonly but in a fancy; they are not very agreeable, and there is but little pleaſure taken in eating them. Mean while they are not without their uſe, and contribute ſomething to our Health. They are both ſo near ally'd in qualities that a Perſon will not deceive himſelf if he takes the one for the other. They are cold and dry when they are hard, but when they are ſoftiſh they acquire a better heat, by a ſort of Corruption, that is to ſay, that they are not ſo cold; after
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:154132:191"/>the firſt way they reſtringe more and nouriſh leſs: and they ought to be uſed as Quinces, and to be eaten after Meals ſoft, Crud, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, Boyl'd in Wine with Powder Sugar and Cinnamon, or finally Fryed in freſh Butter, which does not render them diſagreeable to the taſte through the Skill of the Cook.</p>
                           <p>But becauſe after all theſe manners they produce the like effects as Quinces, this will oblige me to paſs in ſilence what I have ſaid in the precedent Article: I ſhall only add here, that the Stones of Medlars being powdred, and then taken by the Mouth to the weight of a Gold Crown in White-wine, cleanſe the Reins of their Impurities, and ev'n drive forth Stones which are ſmall enough to paſs through the <hi>
                                 <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>reters,</hi> and afterward through the Paſſage of the Urine.</p>
                           <p>In reality theſe Stones are extreamly dry, and they have in their matter particles which powerfully penetrate; for experience has taught me that the Stones of Fruits, and the hardeſt bones of Beaſts and Fiſhes provoke Urine as ſpecifick Remedies. I do not doubt but that which <hi>Braſſavolus</hi> has left us in Writing concerning the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of the Stones of Medlars, is true, ſince he proves it by two ſick Perſons who were Cur'd thereby.</p>
                           <p>But we ought not to ſuffer our ſelves to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:154132:192"/>be abus'd on this account by the promiſes of <hi>Quacks</hi> and <hi>Mountebanks,</hi> who boaſt to have certain Remedies for breaking the Stone in the Reins or in the Bladder: I know not whether the Stones of Medlars have more Vertue in <hi>Italy</hi> than in <hi>France,</hi> but at leaſt I know by experience and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that neither the Stones of Medlars, nor all other Remedies have the force to break the Stone, nor to drive it forth of the Bladder, when it is to big too paſs forth.</p>
                           <p>The chief Vertue of <hi>Services</hi> is to cool and to reſtringe, as we have ſaid: its through theſe qualities that they ſerve for power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Remedies againſt moiſt Diſeaſes, againſt inveterate Looſneſſes, and againſt long Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteries. Perhaps the Learned <hi>Bruyerius</hi> had not been Cur'd of a Malignant Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentery which laſted him above a Month, if he had not eaten a great many <hi>Services;</hi> ſo true it is that the preſumptuous bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which we have in trying Remedies in our long Diſtempers, often ſucceeds much better with us than prudence it ſelf.</p>

                        <p>THere are Fruits which may be eaten at all times, becauſe they do not corrupt in our Stomach, but through our fault: Wherefore we ought to have a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar deſign, and different praecautions in uſing them.

And beſides this, another will have a farther deſign of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the Belly ſoluble: thus there may be need of theſe Fruits in different occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>

                           </head>
                           <p>THe moſt excellent Raiſins which our Province furniſhes us with, and which are ordinarily ſerv'd at our Table, are thoſe which are ſweet, taſting of Sugar and Amber: many prefer them to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fruits; and they yield us a Liquor, which is the moſt agreeable and richeſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that ever God gave to Man. If I would extend my ſelf here on the Enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium of Raiſins, I perſwade my ſelf that I ſhould find but too much matter to ſay fine things of them; but, becauſe I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to my ſelf to Write only concerning the uſe of the Fruits of Trees as briefly as poſſible; I muſt be allow'd to deliver my thoughts in a few words concerning the uſe of Raiſins eaten before or after Meals.</p>
                           <p>But before I explain my ſelf thereon, I fancy that I ought to eſtabliſh ſome ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Maxims, for well uſing them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being damnified thereby.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="95" facs="tcp:154132:193"/>A Woman who has the Stomach nice and weak muſt never eat Raiſins newly gather'd; they puff up the Belly, they cauſe a rumbling and winds, and trouble the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of the Stomach: moreover ſhe muſt not eat but of ſuch as are excellent and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ripe, and again ſhe muſt not ſo much as look on thoſe which have grown in the ſhade, and which the Sun has not heated with its rays.</p>
                           <p>To correct the ill quality of Raiſins, they muſt be gather'd ſome days before you will eat them, or elſe you may take ſuch as have been hung up in a Chamber, or if at time of Vintage you have an inclination for eating ſuch as are freſh, they muſt be dipt into boyling Water, and then into freſh Water, and ſo they muſt be ſerv'd to Table.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Raiſins</hi> are moiſt and moderately hot, and by theſe two qualities they are proportionate to the Principles of our Life; they nouriſh much more than other Fruits, if we except Figgs: they revive the Spirits by their ſweet and odoriferous ſavour, they cheer up a Stomach which is languiſhing and heated through Labour, and moiſten the Viſcera, and ſo correct by their pleaſant moiſture the drought and which the heat of Autumn has there caus'd.</p>
                           <p>Nay there are Phyſitians who do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them to their ſick Patients when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:154132:194"/>to amend, tho' on condition that they eat them with Bread, and throw away the Stones and the Skin, as two parts which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be digeſted by a Stomach how robuſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
                           <p>It they are eaten faſting, without Bread, as they come from the Tree moiſtned with the Dew of the Night, they purge the Belly ev'n of thoſe who have it naturally tardy; there is neither Water of <hi>Caſſia</hi> nor <hi>Manna</hi> which ought to be preferr'd to Raiſins ſo eaten.</p>
                           <p>We ought here to remember not to drink Wine unleſs it be well diluted, after having eaten Raiſins faſting: Nay it would be better not to drink at all, or to drink only pure Water; pure Wine mixt in the Stomach with the new Juice of the Raiſins makes ſo extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary a fermentation, that the accidents which ariſe from it are much greater than you may imagin: For the Wine carrys the Chyle and the Juices into the Bowels and into the Reins, before they are digeſted, and ſo cauſes impurities and indigeſtions in the Blood; whereas Water hindring the great ebullition of the Stomach, contributes to a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction; it cauſes the Chyle to become more pure, and that we are more refreſht and moiſtn'd by the uſe of the Raiſins.</p>
                           <p>We ought not ſo to do when we eat them after Meals, for we may drink a good Glaſs
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:154132:194"/>of pure Wine, and not conſider ſo much the Raiſins prepar'd as we have ſaid before, as the food which we have taken at our Meal.</p>
                           <p>Tho the Stones cannot be digeſted, yet we ought not to throw them away when we eat Raiſins after Meals: For ſince they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringent, they correct the great humidity, which is the cauſe of the evils which they bring upon us. We muſt chew them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore very ſmall, and reduce them to minute parts betwixt the Teeth, that they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the Coction of our Stomach, and correct the ill qualities of the Raiſins: It is thus we ought to eat after Meals the dry Raiſins which are brought from <hi>Spain;</hi> for by nouriſhing and lenifying our inward parts they ſolace them by their ſweetneſs, and fortifie them by the aſtriction of their Stones.</p>
                           <p>I ſhall not paſs by here the excellent drink. which is made with dry Raiſins, and is call'd <hi>de Cabat.</hi> The Stones muſt be taken away from fifteen or twenty Pounds, and then the Raiſins muſt be bruis'd a little: and in the Month of <hi>January</hi> or of <hi>February,</hi> which is the time that they are brought to us from <hi>Spain,</hi> they muſt be put in an excellent Barique <hi>(a Veſſel ſomewhat more than our Barrel)</hi> of White-wine to drink at <hi>Eaſter.</hi> This Wine will have the colour of a Spaniſh Wine, it will be pleaſing to the Palat, and will have qualities not to be contemn'd; for it leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:154132:195"/>the Breaſt, appeaſes the Cough, helps re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, and fortifies the Stomach and the Liver, creates an Appetite, oppoſes inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Vomit, ſtops a Looſneſs; in a word, it is an excellent Remedy againſt the <hi>Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy,</hi> it agrees admirably with Old men, with Valetudinarians, with Phlegmatick or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick Perſons, and finally with Women of a tender Conſtitution.</p>

                              <hi>ART. II.</hi> Of China and Portugal Oranges.</head>
                           <p>THe Grafted Orange-trees which were brought from <hi>China</hi> into <hi>Portugal,</hi> and which have been multiplied in the later Kingdom, produce Oranges which have a fine Rind, a vinous Juice, and which are very pleaſant to eat; they may be us'd before or after Meals, for being more moiſt than cold, they qualify alſo after Meals a Stomach too hot and too dry, and ſo help Concoction.</p>
                           <p>Thoſe which are brought us ordinarily from <hi>Portugal</hi> are ſharp or <hi>aigres-douces,</hi> they are colder than the former, and they refreſh
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:154132:195"/>more, and more oppoſe the Corruption of our humours.</p>
                           <p>Sharp Oranges ought never to be us'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Meals, they hinder the digeſtion of the Stomach by their coldneſs, but they are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry proper for quenching the heat of our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and to give us an appetite, if we take the Juice before Meals with Water and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Powder Sugar, but eſpecially when the great heats of the Summer or of Autumn ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſt our ſtrength.</p>
                           <p>I ſay no more here, for that I will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat what I have ſaid in the Article of Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, where you may ſee what ſharp Fruits are capable of doing within us, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions we muſt take to uſe of them. I ſhall only ſay that the Rinds of ſharp Oranges being ſquees'd a little into Wine, renders it more agreeable to the taſte of many Perſons, and makes it paſs more readily by Urine.</p>
                           <p>Our ſick Perſons uſe both the one and the other, and if you will believe them on their own experience, they will tell you that there is not a better Remedy than theſe Fruits for quenching Thirſt, cooling the Stomach, qualifying the Liver, provoking Urine, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away the Heart burning, oppoſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Poyſons; in a word, for Curing the Diſeaſes which are accompanied with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable heat and drought and indeed, if we cut a <hi>China</hi> or <hi>Portugal,</hi> vinous Orange
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:154132:196"/>into four parts, and throw it into a pot of Water with the Rin'd, this drink will have all the Vertues ev'n now mention'd.</p>

                              <hi>ART. III.</hi> Of Spaniſh Pomegranates.</head>
                           <p>WE cultivate in our Gardens ſweet, <hi>Aigres-doux,</hi> and ſharp Pomegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate-trees which came to us from <hi>Spain;</hi> for as for thoſe of <hi>France</hi> which are wild, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eat the Fruits: The Flowers and Rinds of Pomegranates are aſtringent, and both ſerve to Cure our Diſeaſes which are caus'd through a too great humidity. They have the Vertue of conſtringing the parts of our Body together, and of giving them the Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation which they had loſt: The inſide of the Kernels of a Pomegranate is uſeleſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſted, our Stomach cannot diſſolve it, and there is no Body who eats it. There is but the pulp which is about the Kernels that yields an agreeable Juice, wherewith we are often ſolac'd in our ſickneſſes.</p>
                           <p>Sharp Pomegranates ought to be us'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:154132:196"/>Meals, when the Stomach is empty; and if the point of their ſharpneſs does us hurt, as it happens in thoſe who have this part weak and tender, we need but blunt it with Water and Sugar to make a delicious Drink: Then this agreeable Liquor cools the Stomach, quenches thirſt, qualifies the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, weakens the ſharpneſs of the Choler, revives the Heart, reſiſts putrefaction, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes Urine; in a word, its a Drink proper for the Sick and ſound. It is much better than the <hi>Boüillons</hi> of Veal, and of cooling Herbs, which are taken too often in the Summer, and in Autumn to qualify the Entrals, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the heat and drought of the Seaſon: for the continual uſe which is made of <hi>Boüillons,</hi> is wholly an enemy to the Stomach, their ſubſtance relaxes too much the membranes, and to perform well its Office it muſt have a certain temperament which is not too moiſt; whereas the Drink of ſharp Pomegranates, by reſtringing it gently, tempers this part, and at the ſame time all the others.</p>
                           <p>Sweet and vinous Pomegranates do not cool ſo much as the ſharp, but they dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify more, and are more proper for Old and atribilarious Perſons.</p>
                           <p>Thoſe who find a heat in their Bowels, are very much ſolac'd after having ſwallowed ſome Spoonfulls of the Juice of theſe Fruits: It is ſo that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> us'd of them,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:154132:197"/>from whoſe Country Pomegranates were brought: and it were thoſe alſo who taught us by their own experience the greateſt part of the good effects which they cauſe in us, when we uſe of them. It cannot be ſaid what goods the Juice of ſweet and vinous Pomegranates, preſs'd forth, ſcumm'd, and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented may produce: it ſtrongly oppoſes all inward Fluxions, it reſiſts all Fevers which are accompanied with a Looſneſs and an exhauſting of our ſtrength, and it has this proper to it, that it fortifies all our languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parts. If we will make ſome Bottles of it, we muſt ſqueeze forth in a Preſs a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent quantity of Pomegranates, we muſt ſeeth the Juice over a gentle Charcoal Fire to the diminution of the third part, after having well ſcumm'd it, and afterward it muſt be kept for uſe.</p>
                           <p>If we put in White-wine the Kernels of ſweet or vinous Pomegranates, or after the ſame manner as we have preſcrib'd for ſharp Cherries, we ſhall have a Wine which will yield in nothing to all the Remedies which Phyſick has invented hitherto for allaying the burning of the Reins, for cleanſing forth all the filth, and for hindring Stones from being there form'd.</p>

                           <p>THe Red Corands and the White, which we call <hi>Gadelles,</hi> have very near the ſame qualities, tho' the <hi>Gadelles</hi> are more ſharp, and the Red more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to eat. Both of them cool and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring the parts of the Body through which they paſs; they hinder Vomiting, quench drought, blunt the Choler, remove Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, fortify the parts, and they ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace both the healthy and Sick that are heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if they are us'd before or after Meals.</p>
                           <p>Their pungent ſharpneſs ought to be corrected, as that of Cherries and Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granates, or we may make them into a Sugar Paſte or Gelly, which is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for thoſe who have the Stomach weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end by long Sickneſſes; and I have Cur'd many Perſons of conſiderable quality, who had this part very much afflicted by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Vomitings, and had a troubleſome Looſneſs of the Belly, by giving only a
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:154132:198"/>Paſte or Gelly of Corands, and of the moiſt conſerve of Provins Roſes.</p>
                           <p>In Imitation of the <hi>Turks,</hi> during the great heats of the Summer, we may make of the greateſt part of the Fruits before ſpoken of, a ſort of <hi>Sherbet</hi> to be drank with Ice: and I allow young Sanguine and bilous People, who have known by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience that drinking with Ice does not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commode them, I allow them, I ſay, to drink of it, with prudence for allaying the exceſs of their heat: This will be a ſure means to hinder them from being ſet upon by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual and Malignant Fevers, and to keep them in good Health during all the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and Autumn. As for others who are of another temperament, and of another Age, they muſt not touch of it, and they muſt remember that heat, which we muſt not deſtroy, is one of the Principles of our Life.</p>
